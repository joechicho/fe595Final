Most investors will enter this week confused after battling through another topsy-turvy trading week.

Bitcoin nosedived at its worst by 20% over the weekend (more on that below). Last week, the S&P 500 saw five straight losses of at least 1% at one point each day, according to Bloomberg data. Small-cap stocks as measured by the Russell 2000 are officially in a correction.

Does one brave these rockier waters and buy the dip? After all, the strategy has worked wonders in the past five years as markets have been awash in liquidity. What I say is to sit tight. Honestly, you shouldnt be confused at all given the economic implications of the new Omicron variant (and potentially others) and the Federal Reserve soon pulling back the liquidity punch bowl.

I think the team at Goldman Sachs led by Jan Hatzius nicely summed up this weekend why you should be hesitant to buy dips in the market in the near-term. In other words, the market has been right to hate the Omicron variant:

First, Omicron could slow economic reopening, but we expect only a modest drag on service spending because domestic virus-control policy and economic activity have become significantly less sensitive to virus spread.

Second, Omicron could exacerbate goods supply shortages if virus spread in other countries necessitates tight restrictions. This was a major problem during the Delta wave, but increases in vaccination rates in foreign trade partners since then should limit the scope for severe supply disruptions.

Third, Omicron could delay the timeline for some people feeling comfortable returning to work and cause worker shortages to linger somewhat longer.

The read here: the market probably hasnt priced in anything Hatzius discusses above from an economic standpoint. Its currently in the process of figuring things out. Hatzius slashed his first quarter 2022 GDP estimate to 3% from 4.5% primarily due to the spreading Omicron variant.

Story continues

Then the other component at play is in fact the new Jerome Powell-led Fed in 2022, one that is more focused on controlling inflation than providing support to asset markets. To that end, Bank of Americas Chief Investment Strategist Michael Hartnett sets the stage very well for 2022 in this new Fed era:

2021-22 investment backdrop we say similar to early stagflation of late-60s, early70s ... period of inflation & interest rates breaking higher from secular low/stable trading ranges on back of high budget deficits, Vietnam, “Great Society” policies, civil unrest, political and acquiescent Fed; late-60s/70s “stagflation” winners were real assets, real estate, commodities, volatility, cash, emerging markets, all of which held their own versus inflation; losers were bonds, credit, equities, tech, all of which ultimately struggled; we think we’re in the ’69-’71 period.

Harnett is bearish on 2022, and expects a rates shock and tightening financial conditions.

Happy trading! And remember, what goes up must eventually come down.

Odds and ends

Cryptocurrency: Yahoo Finance Editor-in-chief Andy Serwer and crypto reporter David Hollerith did expert jobs this weekend covering the rout in bitcoin prices (down 20% at one point on Saturday). So I wont spend a lot of time on it, other than to say exuberant crypto asset prices are about to be put to the test as the Fed moves off peak liquidity. Those asset prices could also be put to the test this week as the CEOs of six major crypto companies testify at a Dec. 8 hearing of the House Financial Services Committee titled Digital Assets and the Future of Finance: Understanding the Challenges and Benefits of Financial Innovation in the United States. I am very interested to see if execs from Paxos, FTX, Coinbase, Circle, Stellar Development Foundation and Bitfury tell the likes of Congresswoman Maxine Waters that they want more regulation. Now is the groups chance to send along that message, which is one I have been hearing from crypto people for over a year. Ill reiterate: Be careful what you wish for, crytoverse.

Stock market bubble: Berkshire Hathaways Charlie Mungers comments last week on valuations being crazy just like the 2000 dot-com bubble were well taken. I dont agree 100% with the billionaires hot take, but it doesnt take a rocket scientist to see pockets of excess in all sorts of markets at the moment (even in a market off its mid-November record highs). But to push back on Mungers musings, look no further than this years IPO market. Bank of America strategist Jill-Carey Hall points out the number of traditional (non-SPAC) deals year-to-date is tracking the highest since the aforementioned tech bubble of 2000. BUT, as a percentage of market cap, deal value is half of 1999 levels. Sure doesnt look bubblelicious to me, but then again what do I know, Mungers net worth is 4,000 times mine (a rough guess).

DocuSign: Friday was a session for DocuSign that falls under the category for me of wow, I havent seen that in a while. Shares crashed 42% by the close of trading as the company is experiencing slowing growth that took execs by surprise. Hat tip to DocuSign CEO Dan Springer for even coming on Yahoo Finance Live to talk with me and Zack Guzman, while the companys stock plunged 40%. Having said that, watch DocuSign for a short-term dead cat bounce this week — Springer told us he is buying $5 million in company stock on Tuesday because the market reaction looks very overdone. I suspect he wont be alone in trying to pick the bottom.

Small-cap stocks: Few sectors have been harder hit during this two week or so sell-off than small caps, or those of companies with outsized exposure to the U.S. economy. The small-cap Russell 2000 has tanked 12% from its recent high on Nov. 8, per Yahoo Finance Plus data. Yahoo Finances markets wizard Jared Blikre notes on Twitter the iShares Russell 2000 ETF is now at old support levels on the charts. The selling pressure may not yet be over, small-cap experts contend.

Given the uncertainty around the new variant and the economy, it is hard to see investors wanting to add risk heading into year-end, says Steven DeSanctis, Jefferies small and mid-cap strategist (known on Wall Street as the SMID strategist). When these issues are resolved, and we think that will be sooner rather than later, we see small spiking higher, like it has done numerous times since the low in March 2020. We would not be surprised to see a real January Effect with small leaping higher, beating large, and the cyclicals leading the way,

That’s the question that Fed officials will have to answer in its two-day meeting kicking off Tuesday, where the major discussion will focus on the pace of the central bank’s wind down of its asset purchase program.

With inflationary pressures continuing to rise, Fed watchers expect the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to lean into a speedier timeline. On Friday, the Consumer Price Index showed prices rising by 6.8% year-over-year in November — the fastest pace seen since 1982.

For the Fed, which had insisted for most of 2021 that high inflationary readings would be “transitory,” the concern is that it may have to play catch-up to quell any fears of further inflation.

“If the market perceives that the Fed is behind the curve in controlling inflation, it would lead to higher inflation expectations and long-term interest rates, potentially weakening the dollar and pressuring asset values,” said Madhavi Bokil, senior vice president at Moody’s Investors Service.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and his other colleagues on the FOMC have already pledged to address any inflation that would jeopardize the economic recovery — pointing to the possibility of more hastily ending the Fed’s asset purchase program.

“If things continue to do what theyve been doing, then I would completely support an accelerated pace of tapering,” San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told Yahoo Finance on Nov. 23.

Since the depths of the pandemic, the Fed has been buying U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities in the open to signal its commitment to easy money policies.

The Fed was pacing those purchases at a clip of about $120 billion per month until November, when the FOMC charted a path for gradually “tapering” those purchases to a full stop by the middle of 2022.

But Fed officials will now debate the merits of a speedier wind down that could wrap up asset purchases as soon as the first quarter of next year.

Ask the curve itself

Story continues

Luckily, the Fed can consult the curve. The yield curve, which maps out the yields of U.S. Treasuries across different durations, serves as a proxy for investor bets on future growth prospects. Generally speaking, higher longer-term bond yields (and a steeper curve) correspond with optimism over longer-term conditions.

But several yield curve measures show a flatter yield curve. For example, the difference between the U.S. 2-year and the U.S. 10-year Treasuries fell to as little as 75 basis points at the beginning of the month. When that difference falls below 0, markets usually brace for a recession.

The spread between the 10-year and the 2-year U.S. Treasury yields is often used to assess market concerns over a recession. A negative reading on this measure is called a yield curve inversion and is interpreted to be a harbinger for recession. Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis

“From the Fed’s perspective, a flat or inverted yield curve is undesirable,” said Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management.

Marcelli said one reading of the flatter yield curve is the expectation that the Fed is behind the curve, and will need to pump on the brakes abruptly (via interest rate hikes) to stop inflation.

JPMorgan Chief Economist Michael Feroli told Yahoo Finance that he’s not so sure the Fed is all that behind the curve. Feroli said if the Fed had hiked interest rates as early as this year, the strength of the economic reopening would have led to only “moderately lower” inflation.

“They are a little behind the curve, but they can catch up to the curve, I’m quite sure of that,” Feroli said Monday.

The FOMC meeting begins Tuesday and concludes Wednesday, with the policy statement due Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET.

With taper, rate hikes baked into 2022, the chickens may come home to roost in 2023

Buy the taper, sell the fact?

Stocks, which mostly rallied as Federal Reserve officials dropped hints that crisis-era monetary accommodation is nearing an end, are clearly showing signs of wear.

With the Omicron variant of COVID-19 becoming less of a factor for asset markets, signs are emerging that the Fed’s deliberative moves to pull back on purchasing bonds — and then begin a rate hike campaign sometime next year — are starting to worry investors. Seemingly runaway inflation is making both consumers and policymakers alike nervous, and complicating the Fed’s task of engineering a soft landing for the economy.

On Wednesday, markets will get more clarity about the Fed’s plans to taper bond purchases, and where it sees rates going in 2022. But the Morning Brief is here to give our readers the unvarnished truth, straight no chaser — and as ever, there’s both good and bad news.

Barring unforeseen circumstances, i.e. the appearance of a new variant or a global conflagration, for example, investors can probably relax about what 2022 has in store.

Famous last words, perhaps, but we know the Fed is all but certain to tighten monetary policy and growth is likely to slow from current levels — but not to such an extent that’ll cause a downturn. Meanwhile, impossibly tight labor conditions will probably keep unemployment low and available jobs high, for most if not all of next year.

According to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, gross domestic product in 2022 “should remain above average not only for the U.S., but also for the globe,” with headline inflation peaking in the first quarter before tumbling by over half by Q4, he wrote on Monday.

Currently, most Wall Street economists expect the Fed to mete out just one to two rate hikes next year, but they may be forced to get more aggressive if inflation stays at current levels. And the picture could easily get more complicated once the calendar flips to January 2023.

Story continues

A hawkish Fed, bond yields gyrations and a strong dollar have the potential to sow chaos in markets and the economy in 2023. That combination is something strategists at Deutsche Bank referred to as “late-cycle dynamics” that could put downward pressure on prices, but leave a “behind the curve” Fed with “a lot of catching up to do” after a prolonged period of easy money.

In fact, Deutsche’s chief economist Jim Reid noted on Monday that “a common pattern seen across hiking cycles is that growth tends to slow in the year after the hikes have commenced but not the one it takes place in.” The bank’s data found 13 different rate hike cycles in which a recession arrived 3 to 3.5 years later, on average.

Accounting for the lag between growth and changes to monetary policy, “on average, real GDP growth in the first year of the hiking cycle was +4.8%, but that slowed to +2.7% in the second year, and +2.1% in the third year,” Reid said.

“Given the earliest that it took for a recession to materialize after a rate hike is 11 months, then statistically it does appear that 2022 has a very low probability of negative growth,” the economist said. “However the probabilities will build from 2023 onwards if history is to be believed.”

That timetable is consistent with a Bank of America forecast. The bank expects 2022 growth to decelerate from the current year, but check in at a still robust 3.5% annualized rate. Yet in 2023, the bank sees a markedly lower GDP print of 2.5%, and an even less impressive 2.0% in 2024, as the wages of the Fed’s rate hike campaign catch up with the economy.

Arguably worse news is that based on Fed “dot plot” projections, the central bank is still expected to hike rates in 2023 and 2024 — part of the catch up work it needs to do to tame prices — even as the economy slows.

Nearly one-third of hedge fund managers plan to add crypto to their portfolios in the near future, according to firms surveyed by EY for a recent report on the global alternative fund industry. The report, which deemed digital assets an “area of focus” among these investment managers in 2021, marks the latest research to show that crypto is gaining momentum among big money managers.

The “institutionalization of the cryptocurrency ecosystem,” which includes more established exchanges and the emergence of custody solutions, or specialized storage and security systems that help safeguard an investors’ assets like with traditional financial products, are driving hedge funds and other alternative managers to become more active participants in the space, according to EY. Regulatory clarity, which the industry expects to see next year, may also be a “major milestone” in moving the market forward.

“The regulatory framework is one of the major hurdles to wider scale adoption for a lot of investment managers,” Joe McCarney, the global blockchain assurance leader at EY told Yahoo Finance. “But I think when you look at what happened up to this point from a regulatory perspective, youre starting to see some movement.”

UNITED STATES - DECEMBER 8: Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and CEO of FTX, testifies during the House Financial Services Committee hearing titled Digital Assets and the Future of Finance: Understanding the Challenges and Benefits of Financial Innovation in the United States, in Rayburn Building on Wednesday, December 8, 2021. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)

“You’re not going to see full-scale adoption, but most asset managers are having conversations at least to determine if they want to play in this space and what they want to do, because the market is rife with opportunities for people that want to be early movers in certain digital assets,” McCarney added.

Several high-profile hedge funds have outlined plans to foray into cryptocurrencies, including hedge fund Brevan Howard Asset Management, which said in September that it was expanding its crypto business with the launch of a new unit focused on managing crypto and digital assets.

Story continues

Last year, Tudor Investment Corp. founder and Chief Investment Officer Paul Tudor Jones gained the attention of crypto enthusiasts after arguing in an investor memo that bitcoin can serve as an inflation hedge.

Other hedge fund leaders who have publicized their support for bitcoin and other digital currencies include billionaire investors Steven Cohen, who runs Point 72 Asset Management. Cohen said he hoped not to miss out on opportunities presented by digital currencies, shortly after his firm made its first investment in a crypto company in August. Meanwhile, Ray Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, said crypto was a good diversifier but he still has more gold than crypto at a conference earlier this year.

The availability of more digital custody solutions, an umbrella term for various methods of storing and protecting financial assets, has been a driver of manager interest in crypto, according to EY. Internal control reports from these custodians, assessments that have been evaluated by independent parties, have helped firms better weigh regulatory, business, and other risks associated with crypto assets.

EY’s report indicated 31% of hedge funds plan to add crypto to their portfolios in the next one to two years: 26% said they plan to increase their exposures, while 5% said they would maintain them. Among other alternative industry respondents, 13% of private equity firms and 24% of investors in alternative funds expressed interest in allocating to crypto over the same time period.

EY told Yahoo Finance that the response rate could be even higher today compared to earlier this year when the survey was conducted in terms of the number of firms interested in exploring investment opportunities in crypto assets.

“Anecdotally, it feels as though all of our managers are kicking the tires in some way to understand what’s happening with digital assets and whether they fit their investment framework,” said Ryan Munson, a report author and partner in EY’s financial services office.

A separate study released in May by Intertrust Group, a fund administrator based in the Netherlands, also found that hedge funds are looking to significantly expand their crypto exposure. Its survey of 100 hedge fund chief financial officers worldwide showed the execs predicted 7.2% of their assets will be held in cryptocurrencies in the next five years.

Intertrust’s report also listed custodianship of digital assets, how they are stored and protected, as a primary focus of hedge funds as they think about moving forward with crypto allocations.

“From an investor perspective, CFOs are going to have to really ensure they have those controls in place for investors to be comfortable. If one in six expect to invest more than 10% in crypto, then one in six will need to be prepared for that investment,” said Jonathan White, global head of fund sales at Intertrust and an author of the report.

EY’s Munson told Yahoo Finance the return profile of digital assets, which is less correlated to more traditional asset classes and has significant opportunity for upside, was also a factor in garnering the attention of a number of mainstream alternative managers who see alpha-generating opportunities in crypto as the industry and regulators begin to better understand the asset class.

“The clients within the industry who typically tend to be more adverse to regulations in this area may actually react positively to crypto regulation, whereas relative to other areas, increased regulations might be frowned upon,” Munson said. “The right regulatory framework would allow for even more investment opportunities.

Larger asset managers were most likely to boost their exposures, with 36% of hedge fund managers with over $10 billion in assets under management and 32% of hedge funds managing $2 billion-$10 billion outlining plans to do so.

Still, despite rising interest, current participation in the space remains low overall. Only 10% of hedge fund managers reported being allocated to crypto, and just 4% of private equity firms have exposure to the space. Dedicated crypto investments as a percentage of total assets under management are also small relative to other investment strategies, with only 1%-2% for hedge funds.

Among management firms detailing plans to participate in crypto, nearly half said they would invest directly into cryptocurrencies, and 43% expect to allocate to crypto derivatives. More than one-third of managers intend to invest in private companies involved in the crypto industry, and more than one-fourth are considering investments in crypto ETFs. About the same number of managers who completed the survey plan to invest in publicly-traded crypto companies.

“For managers looking to get into the space, the amount of operational lift it takes is not insignificant,” Munson told Yahoo Finance, adding that although institutional solutions have become more robust, much work remains for managers in navigating considerations such as valuation policies, compliance, risk management, and fitting crypto into their investment strategies.

Correction: Ray Dalio has more gold than crypto. That fact was misstated in an earlier version of this article.

It sounds so awesome, like a Tim Ferriss-style optimization hack that solves so many of those persistent overspending problems. And I have to say that this must be true for a ton of people, because it’s such a commonplace money practice.

But total automation doesn’t work for me. Let me paint you a not-so-pretty picture:

I, a newly-hired first-year teacher, make my first budget and set up my automated deposits for my savings accounts. I’ve already received paychecks, so I know what my income will be. Everything’s planned for and ready to go. Money: hacked.

Except it didn’t work that way the first month. Or the second. Or, effectively, ever.

I’m always saying that a budget is a living and breathing thing, and it’s because I learned that lesson the hard way in the beginning of my journey. Unexpected expenses came up during the month, I had to change my budget for irregular expenses before the month began, I would go slightly over budget in a category, or my savings goals would change entirely for one reason or another. Life would happen. This led to me inevitably cancelling one or more automatic deposits each month, only to save a smaller amount, and of course, feeling like a failure.

This is absolutely NUTS, because I was still saving toward my goals (and making good progress, at that). But having to always adjust this thing that was supposed to be “automatic” was not truly optimal in practice. Not at all.

In reality, it added more steps and anxiety, and messed with my momentum. And the kicker is: I’m saving just as effectively without the automation. It was more than unnecessary– it was actually demotivating.

After months of trying to do things the “right” way, I actually started to do things the best way for me. Now, I still save each month, but the amounts vary depending on what expenses I have that month. For example, while my March budget was typical, my February budget included the unexpected cost of paying for coaching courses. Similarly, my January budget included a line for Amazon Prime, which I pay for yearly. Both of these costs that are important to me resulted in the necessity to change my savings amounts, and that was just fine.

By putting the money away myself (and having it be the first thing I do with my paycheck), I can change the amount month-to-month and still incentivise myself to stay in budget, without punishing myself for having atypical expenses. Plus, manually putting money away in my savings is a habit for me– in that way, it feels almost automatic– I just have more power in making necessary changes.

I think there is a place for automation. Namely, I’m planning on investing all my raises directly from my paycheck in favor of hiding them from myself as I build my future. This is a “hack” that I think will actually work for me. But for all– or even some of– my savings accounts, automating deposits was a piece of advice I’m happy I left behind.

If you’re ready to start saving, but aren’t sure how much you can put aside, make sure to grab my budget below. Whether you’re a pen & paper person or a spreadsheet nerd like me, I’ve got you covered. And, of course, it’s free!

See you next week!

Grocery delivery service backups got you down? A young Long Island entrepreneur is looking to provide an alternative.

Joe Chionchio, a 21-year-old Manhattan College finance major, launched his Smart Shop LI service a month ago, after hearing repeated complaints from friends who said thanks to the coronavirus outbreak, finding an open slot to book a grocery delivery service like Instacart, Shipt or Peapod had become practically impossible.

In the last few weeks, public fear over contracting the coronavirus while at the supermarket has meant skyrocketing demand for these companies. Shoppers are encountering messages telling them no delivery service is currently available, or that they cant reserve a delivery time slot for 10 days or more.

Instacarts order volume has grown more than 150%, a spokeswoman said, as the company sees the highest customer demand in its history, with billions of dollars in groceries being sold on the platform.

Chionchio was quick to capitalize on that demand.

Suddenly back at his parents Bay Shore home and feeling down and out about the pandemic having derailed his senior year, he decided to channel his energy into the entrepreneurial pursuit.

I was separated from all my friends, my senior year baseball season canceled, he said. When I learned most services were backed up for weeks, I realized there was something I could do. I could deliver groceries to people and have it at their doorsteps within hours.

In less than a week, Chionchios business had a name and a logo, and after one post on Instagram and another on Facebook, Smart Shop LI had its first customer.

Since then, business has been crazy, it picks up every single day ... [in the last week] weve had about 25 to 30 deliveries, said Chionchio, who has hired five delivery drivers to help him keep up with demand.

Most customers are moms in their 30s and early 40s, but of course weve also had people in their 50s and some in their 20s … with the average shopping list at $150, he said.

Smart Shop LI customers are charged a 15% fee based on the total of their supermarket bill, and can pay using cash or for contactless delivery through online payment app Venmo.

Benazeer Saifee, 45, an East Islip mom who first tried to order groceries from Instacart and Peapod with no luck, discovered Smart Shop LI on a Facebook group for Long Island moms.

Both of those services were backed up for at least two to three weeks, she said.

As soon as I found out about Joes company, I called right away. He immediately picked up and said he could deliver my groceries that same day which of course, I thought was wonderful, especially knowing my money was going to someone in the community.

Once at the store, Chionchio texted Saifee to let her know a product she ordered was out of stock and ask if she would like him to grab something else in its place.

It was very efficient, she said. I was impressed.

Carlos Espinal, 20, a University at Buffalo student, signed on as one of Smart Shop LIs drivers, going on his first run just a few days ago.

I put on my gloves, my mask, packed my hand sanitizer and went to work, said Espinal, adding that though his parents werent thrilled about his new gig because of the risk, they still gave him their blessing before he stepped out the door.

I just want to help them cover expenses like food and utilities, especially now, any way I can, he said.

Stefanie Haeffele, co-author of Community Revival in the Wake of Disaster: Lessons in Local Entrepreneurship, a 2015 book about how entrepreneurs can rebound after natural disasters, said individuals who can quickly shift their skills and talents to fit the needs of their communities in the thick of it can position themselves for success.

Starting a business in the midst of a difficult time is a big risk. One key question to ask is ... Will the business be sustainable once the disaster is over? she said.

For people like Chionchio, if hes able to build customer loyalty during this time, by being there for people when the big guy couldnt — I think the answer is yes.');

Not always. There are a few things (five, to be specific) you should consider before doing so, and we’ll walk through exactly what they are in the article below.

But first, we’ll highlight what a 401(k) is for those not 100% familiar with this amazing retirement tool.

…And, if you haven’t heard of Blooom, they’re a 401(k) robo-advisor that can give you a free 401(k) “check-up”, offering great tips and advice on how to optimize your 401(k). You can get your free analysis with them below:

Not Sure if You’re Doing this 401(k) Thing Right?

The 401(k) Robo-Advisor

401(k) Basics

A 401(k) is a type of investment account that is offered by your employer.

With a 401(k), you designate a percent of your income (paycheck) that you want to contribute and it is automatically deducted and invested for you (based on your pre-selected investment vehicles).

The biggest benefit of a 401(k) is that your money is taken from your paycheck pre-tax. Like most things, this is best explained through an example.

Say you normally get taxed 30% on your $50,000 income and want to invest 10% of your income.

With a 401(k): You would contribute $5,000 ($50,000 x 10%). You get to invest the money before paying the 30% tax!

With a brokerage account: You would only contribute $3,500 ($50,000 x 70% x 10%). You first have to pay taxes before you can invest.

On top of this huge tax break, sometimes your employer will provide a 401(k) match. This is when they also contribute to your 401(k). The most common practice is a company matching 50% of the first 6% you contribute (though this usually varies by company). Here are a couple examples to help illustrate the 50% match up to 6%:

Example 1: You contribute 3%, employer contributes 1.5%. Total = 4.5%.

You contribute 3%, employer contributes 1.5%. Total = 4.5%. Example 2: You contribute 6%, employer contributes 3%. Total = 9%.

You contribute 6%, employer contributes 3%. Total = 9%. Example 3: You contribute 9%, employer contributes 3%. Total = 12%.

You should always max out your employer contributions (at least getting to example 2), this is free money!

With all of that said, there are a few rules that apply to your 401(k) to be aware of as well:

Max Contributions: The max contribution for any individual is $19,500 annually, while the max contribution for the individual + employer is $58,000 annually.

The max contribution for any individual is $19,500 annually, while the max contribution for the individual + employer is $58,000 annually. Withdrawal Rules: Money withdrawn before age 59.5 is subject to a 10% additional tax.

Money withdrawn before age 59.5 is subject to a 10% additional tax. Mandatory Withdrawals: Similar to Traditional IRAs, you must start withdrawing from the plan starting at age 72 (if you were born after June 30, 1949).

Checklist: What to Do Before You Max Out Your 401(k)

Now you’re eager to max out your 401(k) to take advantage of those great tax benefits… great!

However, before diving in head first, there are a few (five) personal finance basics you need to take care of before you max out your 401k or 403b.

1. Pay Off Short Term Debt

Short term debt is what I will label as “bad debt”. Usually it’s either unintended (like credit card debt) or has a high interest rate (like credit card debt and/or student loan debt).

These are debts you usually want to get paid before maxing out your 401k. Specifically, they could include:

Credit Card Debt

Student Loan Debt

Bank loans

Car loans (sometimes)

This does not include debt like mortgages. While you can decide to prioritize your mortgage over a 401(k), it’s not necessary.

2. Get Insurance

This one is easy: get necessary insurance before investing.

This could include anything like car, home, medical, and/or life insurance. Don’t get caught unprepared for an emergency, because your 401(k) should not be your lifeline to help with short term issues that arise.

Speaking of emergencies…

3. Set Up an Emergency Fund

Most people recommend 3-6 months saved up in a liquid account. However, you should do whatever helps you sleep at night knowing you have money saved for an emergency (getting laid off due to a recession, a big medical bill, etc.).

A high yield savings account is the best place to store this fund, in my opinion.

4. Consider Other Tax-Advantaged Accounts

Depending on your income and where you are at in life, it may be wise to invest in other tax advantaged accounts before you max out your 401(k).

Here are some accounts to consider:

Roth IRA: A Roth IRA is, in simple terms, is the opposite of a 401(k). Instead of contributing pre-tax money, you contribute post-tax money but do not pay taxes when you withdraw your earnings. A Roth IRA can be useful for someone in a low tax bracket now who thinks they will be in a higher tax bracket when they retire.

Health Savings Account (HSA) : A health savings account is a unique account that can be useful for both retirement savings and medical expenses.

5. Ensure You Have Enough Saved for Near-Term Goals

Last thing to consider is: can you pay the bills?

It’s a lot easier for someone making $100,000 a year to max our their 401k (19% of paycheck) compared to someone making $40,000 a year (nearly 50% of their income).

Obviously, you need to make sure you have enough money left on your paycheck to pay the bills.

Then, you can assess if you have enough money for major short term expenses or goals, like having a baby or making a down payment. These short term goals and expenses will likely come before you have penalty-free access to your 401(k).

Why Maxing out Your 401(k) Is a Good Decision

Assuming you have squared away all five considerations above, maxing out your 401(k) can be a great next step for you! It’s a better decision than keeping money hoarded away in a savings account, or even in a different brokerage account (that is not tax advantaged).

Here are two examples to help illustrate this point, with the following assumptions for both:

Income : $50,000

: $50,000 Total Tax Rate : 25%

: 25% Market Growth Rate : 7%

: 7% Timeline: 40 years

Example 1: Investing $5,000

In the example where someone wants to invest $5,000, whether they choose a brokerage account or 401k they will net the same amount of money at the end of their investing lifespan.

Both will have approximately $1 million dollars after 40 years.

Not bad!

However, the person investing in the 401(k) would have enjoyed a $33,750 after-tax income ever year. While the person investing in a brokerage account would have only had $32,500.

That is $1,250 less than the person investing in a 401(k).

How many of you would like an extra thousand dollars ever year to spend?!

Example 2: Investing 10%

Now, let’s assume both people want to invest 10% of their income rather than a flat $5,000.

This time, both individuals would enjoy an after tax income of about $33,750.

However, the individual investing in a brokerage is only investing $3,750 per year (after paying taxes). While the person with a 401(k) is investing $5,000 a year (investing 10% before paying taxes).

At the end of 40 years, the 401(k) investor would have close to $1 million, while the brokerage account investor would have only $750,000.

A quarter of a million dollars difference!

This is why, if you can, choosing your 401(k) over non-tax advantaged investment accounts is a huge benefit over the long run.

How to Choose the Right 401(k) Investment Vehicles

Unfortunately, 401(k)s do not always have a wide variety of low cost index funds like Vanguard or Charles Schwab.

Here are some things to look for when picking your 401(k) investments:

Diversification: Having the right mix of bonds vs stocks is a good first step. From there, you can decide if one stock fund will do, or if you want to branch out into a couple. This article on 3 Fund Portfolios can help guide your decision.

This article on 3 Fund Portfolios can help guide your decision. Low Cost: As with all investing, finding low cost funds is extremely important. With some 401(k) providers, you may have to settle for slightly higher expense ratios, but you should still aim to find the lowest available.

In addition, also consider the type of 401(k) account you are choosing: Traditional vs Roth 401(k).

Working two or more jobs is not unusual these days when most of us are over our heads in debt and trying to save for the future. Whether it’s for making our mortgage or car repayments or having some money on the side to treat ourselves every once in a while, a lot of people look for a side hustle to bring in some extra funds. These range from running errands for other people to working online as a blogger, web designer or virtual assistant. But are side hustles worth it?

Sometimes we are not aware of how having several jobs can affect us and our full-time job. Often, there are more (and better) reasons to focus on our day job seeing as how it can provide us with some benefits that part-time ones are just not able to offer.

Read on to learn more about why you should concentrate on your primary source of income and some ways to improve and potentially get a promotion.

Are Side Hustles Worth It?

Of course, not all jobs are equal. Some jobs simply do not offer the chance to be promoted and work your way up the career ladder. On the other hand, if your job is one of those that do, you should definitely make it your priority. Here’s some reasons why you should focus on your day job.

Getting promoted

If you work hard and your employers take notice, you might be considered for a promotion. Getting promoted at your current day job can make your life much easier. Firstly, you will not have to rush to your part-time job and will have more free time to rest and enjoy life. Secondly, you will probably be receiving a raise.

Earning more

Like we said, promotions usually come with an increase in salary. This career boost might result in you no longer needing a second job. You might be able to cover all your debts and still live comfortably. If you are not in debt, that means that you will have more money in your savings account.

Having benefits

Working for a company full-time can come with many benefits, usually including health, dental and vision insurance, which is something most part-time jobs do not provide. Furthermore, plenty of companies offer to match your 401(k). Other benefits include gym memberships, product discounts and stock purchase opportunities as well as a chance to improve your skills and knowledge. Not being focused enough when it comes to your primary source of income can cost you all these benefits which actually save you money and lower the need for a second job.

How Can You Improve Your Full Time Hustle?

Considering all the aforementioned reasons why your day job is your best side hustle, you can dedicate some time to perfecting your skills and making the most of them. There are plenty of ways how you can work on improving yourself and the chances of advancing your career.

Keep up with employee training

A lot of companies have their employees undergo training on a regular basis and this is something you should use to the fullest. You can acquire relevant skills that might help you get a promotion or a raise and the company is paying for it. This is also a great way to show your employers that you care about your job and that you want to improve. Whether they send you to IT seminars or want you to take part in team building exercises, you should show your willingness to work on yourself.

Invest in your education

If your bosses are not willing to pay for you to acquire the latest skills in the field, that shouldn’t stop you from expanding your knowledge. Look for online classes of all sorts or see whether your local college offers any courses to reach a new level in your career. It doesn’t matter if you think you’re an expert in a certain area, there is always room for improvement. For instance, even experienced advertising specialists take social media marketing courses to better understand current trends. With approximately 3.6 billion people using social networks, the potential for growth and continued learning in this area is enormous. Also, even if you might think you’re a social networking wiz, taking a course might help you realize how to be more efficient and effective at reaching an audience, a skillset that can be applied to a number of business-related exercises.

Diversify your skills

While becoming an expert in your field is a great way to advance, diversifying your skill set is also a fantastic approach to having more success. For example, try doing something that has no direct impact on your current job, like learning a new language or taking up a musical instrument. Plus, you never know when a skill could be useful, maybe understanding a foreign language will come in handy at your new position or helpful in communicating with clients outside of your normal sphere of operation.

Look for a mentor

To advance at your current job, you might want to consider getting a mentor. Look for someone experienced who is willing to work with you, give you advice and help you move up the career ladder. They’ve probably been through something similar and can provide you with a unique perspective and an outsider’s opinion on your current situation. You can turn to a former teacher or manager that you know will be able to assist you in this endeavor.

Improve your communication skills

Communication is essential if you want to be efficient and productive at work. For instance, you need to be able to actively listen as that will help you actually hear what people are telling you. Similarly, you need to work on your speaking skills in order to effectively get your message across. Last but not least, you need to learn how to write effective emails which your bosses and colleagues will read.

Downsides of a Side Hustle

These little things can be just what you need to advance at your current job. Having all the benefits of full-time employment as well as a higher salary and more time should be enough to convince you that your day job is what you should be focusing on.

Side hustles can be time consuming. You need to decide whether or not time spend on a side hustle will lead to more money for you. In the long term, your time very well might be better spent on your full time job.

Chime in!

Are side hustles worth it? Would you be better off financially if you just focused on your full time job?

Biden himself acknowledged that on Dec. 16, when he said he expects Congress to continue working on the bill “in the days and weeks ahead.” Democrats had hoped an end-of-year deadline would serve a forcing function to get the bill done and clear the decks for 2022. They couldn’t pull it off.

That means two things.

First, it’s an obvious setback for Biden and his fellow Democrats in Congress. Biden campaigned on the social-welfare expansions and green-energy investments contained in the legislation, and the Democrats’ surprise capture of two Senate seats in Georgia made it possible to pass. But the Democrats have miscalculated all year long, believing that a tiny one-vote majority would open the door to a long list of priorities held mostly by the party’s liberal “progressive” wing. There are still a few moderates in the party unwilling to write blank checks for various social programs, and they’ve blocked BBB, as it is known.

Second, the focus on BBB obscures two genuine wins for Biden this year: The big relief bill Democrats passed in March, with no Republican support, and the infrastructure bill Congress passed in November with some GOP votes. The relief bill kept Covid relief going to millions of families, and it gave voters a taste of enhanced social spending—mainly, the advanceable child tax credit—that Democrats and even some Republicans would like to see permanent. The infrastructure bill was a heavy lift Biden’s predecessor, President Trump, couldn’t hoist. If Democrats weren’t flailing on BBB, Biden would look considerably more successful in his first year than he does.

U.S. President Joe Biden delivers remarks on the Build Back Better Act and its impact on the cost of prescription drugs during a speech in the East Room at the White House in Washington, U.S., December 6, 2021. REUTERS/Leah Millis

[Click here to get Rick Newman’s stories by email.]

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina insists that Build Back Better is “dead forever.” It isn’t. Democrats can still pass the legislation in 2022, if they can agree on what should be in it. Beneath the party’s dysfunction, there’s actually progress. All 50 Senate Democrats now seem comfortable with the $1.7 trillion price tag, which is sharply discounted from the $3 trillion-plus that Biden started with. The disagreement is over how to spend that money.

If Democrats can’t figure that out by early next year, they will deserve whatever punishment voters mete out in the 2022 midterms. “It would be perhaps one of the greatest own goals in legislative history if Democrats cant pass Build Back Better at this point,” Beacon Policy Advisors advised in a Dec. 17 research note. “They have the top line – $1.75 trillion. They have the legislative vehicle. They just need to agree on the goodies.”

Story continues

U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) points to charts during a news conference on the Congressional Budget Office score of U.S. President Joe Bidens Build Back Better plan, at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S., December 10, 2021. REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger

Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who holds a de facto veto over the legislation, objects to the short-term implementation of an expanded child tax credit, which Democrats hope to make permanent some day. The current bill would continue the credit for just one year, which helps lower the cost of legislation. But then what? If the votes aren’t there to extend the credit in 2022, it was a temporary experiment of dubious value. If the votes are there to extend it, it will validate GOP criticism that Democrats intend to spend a lot more than $1.7 trillion.

Possible solutions that might get the bill to the finish early next year: eliminate the expanded tax credit altogether and spend more money on other things, such as green energy. Or curtail eligibility for the credit but extend it for longer. Or some mishmash including these types of changes and more.

Biden’s first year in office is almost up, bringing the inevitable comparisons to his predecessors during their own first years. President Obama signed a big relief bill during his first term in office, with his other legislative lift, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), coming in his second year. Both turned out to be relatively unpopular, even if they were beneficial overall.

President Trump signed a big tax cut law into effect during his first year, fulfilling a long-time GOP goal. That too, was relatively unpopular, however, since voters felt it disproportionately benefited businesses and the wealthy. Trump also failed to repeal the ACA, leaving one of his main campaign promises unfulfilled.

By comparison, Biden has done pretty well, with two big bills signed and decent odds he’ll ink BBB within a month or two. Voters, for now, are bummed about never-ending Covid and a surprise bout of inflation, which should be Biden’s key focus in 2022 if he wants Democrats to have a fighting chance in the midterms. Building back, whenever it happens, leaves many more jobs to do.

In a report issued on Friday, The Financial Stability Oversight Council – a regulatory group created after the financial crisis to monitor risks financial firms pose to the overall economy and financial system — noted that rapid growth of digital currencies – including stablecoins, and crypto lending and borrowing – is an “important potential emerging vulnerability.”

Chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and composed of the heads of the top financial regulatory agencies, the FSOC includes the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

They warn that it’s unclear how much is tied directly to the economy, but added that even as the sector grows in popularity among small buyers, it “may not be appropriate for many investors.”

Officials also caution in general about the possibility of operational failures, fraud and market manipulation in crypto, where scams have proliferated recently. They emphasize risks with direct or indirect connections with banking services, financial markets and financial intermediaries, and cautioned about money laundering, tax evasion and use of cryptocurrencies in ransomware attacks.

Specifically, the report zeroed in on stablecoins — an asset class designed to smooth out digital coin volatility that’s now worth nearly $166 billion itself – and the potential for a run on stablecoins. Strained market conditions could amplify a shock to the economy and the financial system, regulators say.

The stablecoin worry

Stablecoins are digital currencies with values tied to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, or short-term securities, and are used by traders to get in and out of trades. They are central to many crypto activities, and increasingly are being used for lending or borrowing in other digital assets on cryptocurrency exchanges.

Story continues

Regulators worry about runs on the digital coins, and their use in payment systems, which may face some of the same basic risks as traditional payment systems that impact credit, liquidity, governance and settlement.

The agency said it’s prepared to consider steps available to it to address risks of stablecoins if Congress doesn’t enact legislation. But senior Treasury officials say that there is no specific time horizon, deadline or threshold at this time for determining whether to designate stablecoins as systemically risky.

Officials are hoping Congress enacts legislation, even as they continue to assess and monitor risks. They recommend at this time state and federal regulators use the tools and authorities they currently have to regulate stablecoins and crypto generally.

The FSOC’s assessment comes after the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG) – composed of mostly the same members of financial regulatory agencies as FSOC, released a report this fall detailing the risks of stablecoins.

Officials have recommended that only banks be allowed to issue stablecoins, while asking Congress to come up with a new regulatory framework to oversee the asset class. A range of regulatory agencies including the SEC, Fed, CFTC and FDIC, are currently assessing their tools and authorities to regulate crypto.

Regulators have sketched out a to-do list for 2022 they’re calling the “crypto sprint,” which will focus on oversight of how banks could store crypto assets safely, handle exchanging fiat currency for crypto, and processing trades, among other things.

On Capitol Hill, top legislators are busy playing catch up with the booming sector. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown told Yahoo Finance this week his committee is looking seriously at new rules for stablecoins in the New Year, but hasn’t settled on specifics yet. At the same time, Senator Pat Toomey, the committee’s top Republican, just rolled out a set of guiding principles for regulating stablecoins.

This is also the first report from FSOC to highlight the risk of climate change to financial stability. Officials recommend taking “prompt action” to improve data and measurement tools to assess climate risks to the financial system, and advise regulators to promote consistent disclosures that allow investors to take climate into account for investment and lending decisions.

As ever, we cant forget about China

The world’s largest economy — rife as it is with attendant crises, policy shifts and political intrigue — is a constant focus for investors. Therefore, it’s sometimes easy to lose sight of what’s happening in the second largest.

The ongoing turmoil of Evergrande, which ricocheted across markets a few months ago and is now being sued for over $13 billion by creditors, is a stark reminder that while China isn’t quite falling apart, it’s not exactly an island of stability either.

In fact, Deloitte’s fourth quarter CFO Signals survey, released on Thursday, found that finance chiefs are getting gloomy about what 2022 has in store for the global economy — and China is a particular worry after a surprisingly sluggish 2021.

The firm’s data found that 45% see North America as better, compared to 54% in Q3; meanwhile, only 27% think China will be better, which is down from a whopping 55% last quarter. Currently, Deloitte found that “29% of CFOs see current conditions as good or very good, a significant decline from 52%” in the Q3.

So what gives?

Evergrande’s woes are certainly one element, but Beijing’s increasingly antagonistic relationship with the U.S. — and the raging COVID-19 pandemic — are arguably even bigger factors. In research this week, Goldman Sachs cited the potential for border restrictions stemming from the Omicron variant as a concern for Asia-Pacific growth.

While not the firm’s base-case, zero-COVID lockdown strategies in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan are a potential wild card, “especially if Omicron proves similar enough to existing variants in terms of health consequences.

According to Goldman, “back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that a return to restrictions half as severe as during peak Delta could cut 1-3 [percentage points] from first-quarter GDP in most regional economies.”

Story continues

With the Federal Reserve’s hiking campaign stealing the spotlight for markets as it tries to make up for lost ground on inflation, Pacific economies are in a more mature phase of their expansion.

“Many of the Asian economies that were the first to recover in 2020 are now further along in their cycles versus other parts of the world,” Henry H. McVey, KKR’s head of global macro and CIO, wrote recently.

“Remember, for example, China was the first to rebound after the pandemic, and as a result, it actually started tightening monetary policy in 2020,” he added.

Recently, Beijing has moved to assuage concerns about the economy, and alleviate investors concerns by cutting reserve requirement ratios for banks. However, Eurasia Group pointed out that Evergrande is heightening fears about “systemic risks,” and the possibility of farther-reaching disruptions.

“While policymakers are stepping up efforts to limit the risks to growth from the property sector crackdown by marginally loosening restrictions on financing, the extent of actions outlined to date is unlikely to prevent further defaults or quickly arrest the continued downturn in property sales and construction. This will continue to weigh on activity and financial conditions in coming months,” Eurasia analysts wrote this week.

DBRS Morningstar recently said that fears about the country’s property sector were “sufficiently counterbalanced by economic and policy buffers,” but that other factors may still trigger a downturn. All of which highlights how dependent worldwide growth is on China, and how the bursting of a property bubble can spill over into the region, and the West.

The longer-term question is: Is China rotating from this rapid growth model to a more mature model with less leverage, less dependence on cheap labor, etc.? Charles Schwabs Kathy Jones told Yahoo Finance back in September. That could have ripple effects longer term in terms of growth in the global economy.

They were a big part of Joe Biden’s pitch to voters when he ran for president in 2020. Biden vowed to undo some of the Trump tax cuts and make businesses and the wealthy pay their “fair share.”

America’s fat cats are an evasive target, it turns out. Biden’s proposed tax hikes weren’t drastic. He wanted to raise the corporate rate from 21% to 28%, still far below the 35% rate it was at before Republicans cut the business tax in 2017. Biden also would have raised the top personal income tax rate from 37% to 39.6%, putting the top bracket back where it was before Republicans lowered it. There were other Biden proposals for raising capital gains and inheritance taxes on the wealthy. His plan stipulated that nobody earning less than $400,000 a year would face a tax hike.

Voters broadly support those types of tax hikes, to pay for other programs and narrow the annual deficit. Yet Congress can’t get them done. “Are taxes going up? Quite simply, no,” Libby Cantrill, head of public policy for investing firm PIMCO, wrote in a recent analysis. The sweeping tax increases that were envisioned by Biden as recently as two months ago, including the rollback of most of the Trump tax cuts, are unlikely to occur. Unless you make an adjusted gross income of more than $10 million (and congratulations if you do), your income taxes are not going up.”

[Click here to get Rick Newman’s stories by email.]

The absence of substantial tax hikes limits what Democrats can pack into the “build back better” legislation they hope to pass soon, because there’s not much new revenue to pay for social-welfare and green-energy programs included in the bill. Biden has vowed to “pay for” any new spending programs with offsetting tax hikes, and while that’s a term of art in Washington, DC, the Biden bill has shrunk along with the available revenue. Legislation that could have entailed more than $3 trillion in new spending over a decade is now down to around $1.7 trillion — and even that may never pass.

There are some narrow tax hikes in the current BBB legislation. There would be a minimum 15% tax on about 200 large companies, along with a 1% tax on stock buybacks and a modest change in international business taxation. There would also be a surtax on the superwealthy, starting with incomes of $10 million per year. The Congressional Budget Office estimates those tax hikes would raise $1.27 trillion during the next 10 years, or $127 billion per year. Biden’s original tax plan would have raised about $4.3 trillion during the same period, or $430 billion per year, according to the Tax Policy Center. That’s a downward revision of 70%.

The whole bill could be doomed

Even that may never happen. The House of Representatives passed the BBB in November, but it’s stuck in the Senate, where a couple of moderate Democrats have raised objections. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona led the charge to remove most business and income-tax hikes. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia is concerned about the overall cost, and the gimmicky nature of including costly provisions, such as an expanded child tax credit, for just one year, forcing future showdowns over renewing those benefits again and again. With a one-vote majority in the Senate, Democrats can’t lose a single vote.

Biden was hoping he’d have a bill to sign by the end of 2021. That now looks unlikely. Congress could pass it in early 2022, but all Senate Republicans will oppose it and it’s not clear how Democrats will resolve their own differences. If there’s no deal by March, the whole thing could be doomed, since it gets harder to pass contentious legislation as elections such as next year’s November midterms draw closer.

There’s one major beneficiary of the disappearing tax hikes: financial markets. Many analysts felt markets could withstand most of Biden’s original tax plan, given that stocks did fine when the corporate rate was all the way up at 35%. Now, there’s no broad increase in the corporate tax rate, and the minimum corporate tax will only apply to the most profitable companies. Some companies will get around a new tax on buybacks by raising dividends instead. After Biden took office, market analysts churned out reams of projections on how the Biden tax plan would affect specific sectors and companies. Now, there’s barely any chatter about the impact of new taxes.

Voters may be fine with Biden’s shrinking agenda, as well. While Americans support higher taxes on the wealthy in general, they get nervous when Congress begins to craft specific laws — and they’re not thrilled about build back better. Support for the bill hovers around 40%, which is very weak for legislation that would affect millions of Americans for years. Biden has already signed major relief and infrastructure bills, and that may seem like enough, for now. Raise taxes some other time.

Digital coins extended gains on Thursday after the Fed stepped up its taper, and laid the foundation for a tightening cycle that could bring as many as three rate hikes in 2022. Normally, cryptocurrency benefits from loose monetary policy and its inflationary side-effects; but at least for now, investors are taking the longer view.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD), barely a week removed from an ugly selloff that dragged it below $50,000, rallied by over 2% on the day.

Other digital coins that power smart contract layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum (ETH-USD) — which helps power the blockchain for the majority of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other smart-contract applications like Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) — Solana (SOL1-USD), Terra (LUNA1-USD) and Avalanche (AVAX-USD) are also posting big gains.

Its been a rough fall for cryptocurrencies, even as the introduction of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) lure in smaller investors. In recent weeks, the value of the asset class has plummeted by more than $700 billion from almost $3 trillion to $2.15 according to Coinmarketcap.

Fears over the Feds policy and the Omicron variant of COVID-19 have contributed to a volatile tone in markets, with crypto trading in tandem with risk-sensitive stocks.

Louis LaValle, a managing director with crypto investment firm 3iQ Digital Assets U.S., told Yahoo Finance that cryptos whipsawing is linked to the sheer volume of new investors, especially institutions, who purchased digital coins for the first time this year.

That includes billions that have flooded into crypto derivatives. Open interest on BTC futures is down by $10 billion since October, but still more than twice as high as the $8 billion it saw a year ago, according to data from The Block.

Braced for the worst, getting the best

Though the Feds policy shift signals a less desirable environment for growth-minded investors, it did exactly what was expected by quelling short-term inflation fears, according to Jon Wolfenbarger, market analyst and CEO of Bull and Bear Profits, an investing service. That created a buying opportunity, he added.

People were bracing for something worse and because that didnt happen, investors are relieved and were seeing a relief rally in stocks and crypto. But one day or a few days doesnt mean much, Wolfenbarger pointed out.

Trending lower since November, cryptocurrencies corrected in a big way early this month when large derivatives positions liquidated en masse. Bitcoin has yet to fully recover, consistently running into resistance around $50,000.

Even worse, the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index — which measures investor sentiment like volatility, social media and trading volume — points to a fearful, even bearish market, but some of that has dissipated after the Fed.

Yuya Hasegawa, an analyst with Tokyo-based crypto exchange Bitbank, said investors had ample time to price in the central banks newfound hawkishness since Fed Chairman Jerome Powell took a more assertive stance in a Senate hearing.

Anything less aggressive than what is expected sends bitcoin higher, Hasegawa told Yahoo Finance.

More clarity around the taper schedule might also help investors see a longer runway before rate hikes according to Edward Moya, Oandas senior market analyst.

The playbook for the next several months is that risk appetite could remain in place if the Fed only has to deliver only a few rate hikes next year, which would be great news for cryptos, said Moya.

End of year market

Profit taking, especially for tax preparation, also played against the bullish buyers of the asset class over the last month.

Andrew Gordon, an attorney and CPA with Gordon Law, told Yahoo Finance that his clients are both selling at a gain to avoid paying higher taxes next year — and selling at a loss to offset their overall tax burden, especially when it comes to non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

However, a few bulls, like cryptocurrency trader Philip Swift, remain optimistic based on other factors.

We are actually seeing growth in Bitcoin active addresses outpace price growth. So on a relative basis, the network is growing despite the weak recent price action. This is bullish as it indicates the network is healthy, Swift told Yahoo Finance via Twitter.

3iQs LaValle also sees the current investing environment for cryptocurrencies as more advantageous.

Were pushed out to the middle or back half of 2022. So I dont think that rates are really going to have a near term effect on asset prices, LaValle added.

The S&P 500 and Dow declined sharply while the Nasdaq traded slightly lower after a sell-off on Thursday. The Dow was the biggest laggard on the day, shedding more than 1% as shares of financials including Goldman Sachs (GS), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) lagged.

Shares of FedEx (FDX) jumped after the shipping giant raised its full-year earnings forecast, delivered better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results and authorized a new $5 billion stock buyback program. Rivian (RIVN), meanwhile, saw shares sink following its first quarterly report since its IPO last month. The electric-vehicle maker said in its shareholder letter it expected to be a few hundred vehicles short of its prior target of producing 1,200 units by the end of this year.

Investors main focus this week has remained fixed on the Federal Reserves updated outlook on monetary policy for next year, with the central banks projections delivered mid-week suggesting the Fed could hike interest rates three times next year.

The specter of higher rates — and a lower-liquidity environment as the central bank also speeds up the tapering process of its asset purchases — has continued to weigh heavily on longer-duration technology and growth stocks valued heavily on future earnings potential. The Nasdaq Composite had underperformed to drop 2.5% on Thursday and give back all of its gains after a rally on Wednesday. The index has fallen by 5% over the past month through Thursdays close. And shares of some notable technology stocks extended declines on Friday, with Apple (AAPL) shares dropping by about 1% after a nearly 4% decrease on Thursday.

On the other hand, cyclical stocks in the energy and financials sectors outperformed on Thursday, with the prospects of higher interest rates and stronger growth seen as benefitting these sectors.

The thing investors have to understand is, were going through a major transition in monetary policy, Troy Gayeski, FS Investments chief market strategist, told Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday. The Fed has been running emergency policies arguably far longer than they should have been, and as that money supply growth slows down as they ease off the balance sheet expansion and ultimately hike next year, one would at least expect more volatility in markets. And thats really what weve been seeing the last month.

Story continues

The biggest difference between now and six months ago, or even more than a year ago, is you could pretty much go long anything and you were confident it was going to go up. The economy was booming, we had a lot of fiscal stimulus, we still had unprecedented monetary policy stimulus, he added. And its a very different environment in 2022 where youre going to have to pick and choose much more carefully.

Summary Omicron five times likelier to cause reinfections

No sign milder than Delta, but some say too early to know

Two-dose vaccines offer little or no Omicron protection

Dec 17 (Reuters) - The risk of reinfection with the Omicron coronavirus variant is more than five times higher and it has shown no sign of being milder than Delta, a study showed, as cases soar across Europe and threaten year-end festivities.

The results of the study by Imperial College London were based on UK Health Security Agency and National Health Service data on people who tested positive for COVID-19 in a PCR test in England between Nov. 29 and Dec. 11.

We find no evidence (for both risk of hospitalisation attendance and symptom status) of Omicron having different severity from Delta, the study said, although it added that data on hospitalisations remains very limited.

Controlling for vaccine status, age, sex, ethnicity, asymptomatic status, region and specimen date, Omicron was associated with a 5.4-fold higher risk of reinfection compared with Delta, the study, which was dated Dec. 16, added.

The protection afforded by past infection against reinfection with Omicron may be as low as 19%, Imperial College (ICL) said in a statement, noting that the study had not yet been peer reviewed.

The researchers found a significantly increased risk of developing a symptomatic Omicron case compared to Delta for those who were two or more weeks past their second vaccine dose, and two or more weeks past their booster dose.

The study involved AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines.

Depending on the estimates used for vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection from the Delta variant, this translates into vaccine effectiveness of between 0% and 20% after two doses, and between 55% and 80% after a booster dose.

This study provides further evidence of the very substantial extent to which Omicron can evade prior immunity given by both infection or vaccination, study lead Professor Neil Ferguson said in ICLs statement.

This level of immune evasion means that Omicron poses a major, imminent threat to public health.

TOO EARLY?

But Dr Clive Dix, former Chair of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, said it was important not to overinterpret the data.

The conclusions made are based on making assumptions about Omicron where we still dont have sufficient data, Dr Dix said. For example, we have no data on the cellular immune response which is now probably driving effectiveness of vaccines.

This is a crucial missing assumption in the modelling.

Some of the conclusions are different to the data emerging from South Africa, where vaccines are holding up well against severe disease and death at present, he said.

There is a huge amount of uncertainty in these modelled estimates and we can only be confident about the impact of boosters against Omicron when we have another month of real-world data on hospitalisation ICU numbers and deaths, he said.

An earlier study by Britains SIREN looking at reinfection risk in health workers, which was carried out before Omicron emerged, found that a first coronavirus infection offered 85% protection from a second for the following six months.

The data analysed by Imperial College was based on 333,000 cases, including 122,062 of Delta and 1,846 which were confirmed as the Omicron coronavirus variant through genome sequencing.

Imperial Colleges Professor Azra Ghani, who co-led the study, described it as essential for modelling the likely future trajectory of the Omicron wave and the potential impact of vaccination and other public health interventions.

The new findings could accelerate the imposition of tighter restrictions across a number of European countries in a bid to stem the new variants spread. read more

REUTERS/Tom Nicholson

CHICAGO, Dec 17 (Reuters) - As the Omicron variant gains momentum in Europe and the United States, scientists are rewriting their expectations for the COVID-19 pandemic next year.

Just weeks ago, disease experts were predicting that countries would begin to emerge from the pandemic in 2022 after enduring a series of surges driven by the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants. First among them would be populations with a significant amount of exposure to the coronavirus, through a combination of infections and vaccination.

In those places, COVID was expected to ease into an endemic disease, hopefully with less-severe periodic or seasonal outbreaks. Vaccines, available for much of 2021 only in wealthy nations, could reach the majority of the global population by the end of the year ahead.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

But the rapid spread of the highly-mutated Omicron variant, identified in late November, and its apparent ability to reinfect people at a higher rate than its predecessors, is undermining that hope.

Already, countries are reverting to measures used earlier in the pandemic: restricting travel, reimposing mask requirements, advising against large gatherings for the winter holidays. While it is not quite back to square one, much more of the world will need to be vaccinated or exposed to COVID to get past the worst of the pandemic, disease experts told Reuters.

People are sick of the pandemic and God knows I am, but unless we can get some urgency to compel our leaders to take action, I really see 2022 being a lot of more of the same that we saw in 2021, said Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.

Even after COVID becomes a more endemic disease, new variants will spawn outbreaks and seasonal surges for years to come.

Theres always going to be a baseline number of COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. A lot of people havent come to terms with that.

The hope is that the virus diminishes to the point where it is no longer disruptive. But living with COVID-19 does not mean the virus is no longer a threat.

Instead, people will need to be ready to adjust when the next variant comes along, said Dr. Tom Frieden, chief executive of Resolve to Save Lives, a global public health initiative, and former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. You need to recognize that at certain times, its going to be safer to do things than at other times.

PANDEMIC PHASE ENDING IN 2022?

Some scientists are not entirely ready to abandon hope that some parts of the world will emerge from the pandemic next year. More than 270 million people have been infected with COVID, according to the World Health Organization, while an estimated 57% of the global population has received at least one vaccine dose, representing potential protection that did not exist two years ago.

Even if that immunity is not as good against Omicron, it doesnt mean that its worthless. And that immunity is more effective against serious illness than it is against getting infected at all, said Dr. David Dowdy, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins.

So far, most of the studies looking at the effectiveness of vaccines against Omicron have focused on neutralizing antibodies, which latch on to the virus and prevent it from entering and infecting cells. Blood test results from fully vaccinated people show Omicron has learned to escape neutralization; a booster dose might restore that protection.

Immune system T cells, which destroy infected cells, also appear still to be able to recognize the variant. Many experts believe this second line of defense will prevent hospitalizations and deaths.

You still have a lot of people who are susceptible because they are not yet vaccinated, said Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist at New York University. She said that was among the reasons she believes it will be some time before the world moves from pandemic to endemic COVID-19.

In the meantime, living with COVID in 2022 will likely mean assessing local risks and protecting oneself through vaccination, masking and social distancing.

When I go to the store this afternoon, what helps me is to know how much COVID is in my community, said Dr. Robert Wachter, chair of the Department of Medicine at University of California, San Francisco.

There will not be one state of the pandemic. There will be different states for different people and for different regions, he said. And thats going to be the way it is for the foreseeable future.

LONDON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The poster child of Chinas property crisis China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) was officially declared in default by credit rating agency S&P Global on Friday after the sprawling firm missed a bond payment earlier this month.

We assess that China Evergrande Group and its offshore financing arm Tianji Holding Ltd. have failed to make coupon payments for their outstanding U.S.-dollar senior notes, S&P said in a statement.

S&P added that Evergrande had asked for the ratings to be withdrawn following the downgrades to selective default a term ratings firms use to describe a missed payment on a bond, but not necessarily all its bonds.

Evergrande, Tianji, or the trustee have made no announcement or any confirmation with us on the status of the coupon payments, S&P said.

Tensions high amid build-up of Russian troops near Ukraine

U.S. says it will talk, but some demands unacceptable

MOSCOW, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Russia said on Friday it wanted a legally binding guarantee that NATO would give up any military activity in Eastern Europe and Ukraine, part of a wish list of security guarantees it wants to negotiate with the West.

Moscow for the first time laid out in detail demands that it says are essential for lowering tensions in Europe and defusing a crisis over Ukraine, which Western countries have accused Russia of sizing up for a potential invasion after building up troops near the border. Russia has denied planning an invasion.

The demands contain elements - such as an effective Russian veto on future NATO membership for Ukraine - that the West has already ruled out.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

Others would imply the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Europe and the withdrawal of multinational NATO battalions from Poland and from the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania that were once in the Soviet Union.

In Washington, a senior administration official said the United States was prepared to discuss the proposals but added: That said, there are some things in those documents that the Russians know are unacceptable.

The official said Washington would respond some time next week with more concrete proposals on the format of any talks.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Washington would talk to its allies. We will not compromise the key principles on which European security is built, including that all countries have the right to decide their own future and foreign policy, free from outside interference, she said.

NATO diplomats told Reuters that Russia cannot have a veto on further expansion of the alliance and NATO has the right to decide its own military posture.

Russia is not a member of NATO and doesnt decide on matters related to NATO, Polish Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lukasz Jasina said.

Ukraines foreign ministry said Kyiv had an exclusive sovereign right to run its own foreign policy, and only it and NATO could determine the relationship between them, including the question of Ukrainian membership.

It urged Moscow to re-engage with a peace process in eastern Ukraine, where some 15,000 people have been killed in a seven-year conflict between Ukrainian government troops and Russian-backed separatists.

SMOKESCREEN

Some Western political analysts suggested Russia was knowingly presenting unrealistic demands which it knew would not be met to provide a diplomatic distraction while maintaining military pressure on Ukraine.

Something is very wrong with this picture, the pol(itical) side appears to be a smokescreen, Michael Kofman, a Russia specialist at Virginia-based research organization CNA, wrote on Twitter.

Sam Greene, professor of Russian politics at Kings College London, said President Vladimir Putin was drawing a line around the post-Soviet space and planting a keep out sign.

Its not meant to be a treaty: its a declaration, he said. But that doesn’t necessarily mean this is a prelude to war. It’s a justification for keeping Moscow’s hair-trigger stance, in order to keep Washington and others off balance.

Presenting Moscows demands, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Russia and the West must start from a clean sheet in rebuilding relations.

The line pursued by the United States and NATO over recent years to aggressively escalate the security situation is absolutely unacceptable and extremely dangerous, he told reporters.

Ryabkov said Russia was not willing to put up with the current situation any longer, and urged Washington to come up with a constructive response fast.

He said Russia was ready to start talks as soon as Saturday, with Geneva a possible venue, but Russian news agency TASS quoted him as saying later that Moscow was extremely disappointed by the signals coming from Washington and NATO.

TROOP BUILD-UP

Moscow handed over its proposals to the United States this week as tensions rose over the Russian troop build-up near Ukraine.

It says it is responding to what it sees as threats to its own security from Ukraines increasingly close relations with NATO and aspirations to become an alliance member, even though there is no imminent prospect of Kyiv being allowed to join.

The Russian proposals were set out in two documents - a draft agreement with NATO countries and a draft treaty with the United States, both published by the foreign ministry.

The first, among other points, would require Russia and NATO not to deploy additional troops and weapons outside the countries where they were in May 1997 - before the accession to NATO of any of the former communist states in East Europe that for decades were dominated by Moscow. It would mean NATO abandoning any military activities in Ukraine, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia.

The treaty with the United States would prevent Moscow and Washington from deploying nuclear weapons outside their national territories. That would mean an end to NATOs so-called nuclear-sharing arrangements, where European NATO members provide aircraft capable of delivering U.S. nuclear weapons.

MAYFIELD, Kentucky, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Jimmy Galbreath counted his blessings too soon. His home in Mayfield, Kentucky, was battered but not broken last week by a tornado, and the 62-year-old former scrap iron worker planned to keep living there.

Then on Thursday rain soaked the state, with another downpour forecast for Friday into Saturday afternoon. As Galbreath watched, water leaked steadily into his kitchen, finding paths opened by two trees that had smashed into his house during the tornado.

I cant stay in here, its impossible, said Galbreath, who collects social security. He said he was looking to buy a camper to live in.

This is going to be a long haul, its not going to be no easy fix, he said of his uninhabitable house.

Rebuilding hard-hit Kentuckycities like Mayfield and Dawson Springs will take years, with entire neighborhoods and numerous workplaces wiped out by the most severe U.S. tornadoes in a decade. At least 74 people in Kentucky and 14 elsewhere died in the storms.

GAPING HOLES

Many homes, businesses and churches in Mayfield, population 10,000, already have blue tarps nailed over their gaping holes, but on other structures, roofs and glass-less windows remain open to the sky.

As the rain began, water quickly pooled in streets as debris from the tornados destruction clogged storm drains.

Some residents opted to stay in their damaged homes after tornadoes struck last week instead of moving in with family, or into shelters, as others did. Nearly all hotel rooms within an hours drive of Mayfield are full, forcing even some out of town emergency personnel to drive a long daily commute.

Mayfield expects a further half inch (12.7 mm) of rain on Friday, with potential for heavier amounts, and showers continuing on Saturday, according to The Weather Channel.

Once the rain passes, temperatures are forecast to dip below freezing on Sunday.

David Burke, chief program officer for non-governmental organization Team Rubicon, said the weather is likely to force more Kentucky residents out of their homes.

With rain on the way, he said, Team Rubicon volunteers have accelerated the pace of fixing tarps to homes across the state and helping residents move valuables to more secure areas.

There are a lot of homes that are a total loss, but a lot of homes that can still be repaired if they can keep the water out, Burke said.

Some shelter beds are available. Fourteen emergency shelters are open in Kentucky, Tennessee and Arkansas, enough for 550 people, said American Red Cross spokesperson Jenelle Eli.

One, recently opened in a Mayfield church, was empty when the rain started on Thursday but is expected to fill once the weather turns cold, a worker on duty said.

Mark Bruce, 64, who works for farm machinery dealer John Deere in Mayfield, salvaged sheet metal from tornado debris to patch holes in his roof. As rain fell, he looked up and said he hoped it would be enough.

We think were in the dry. We feel very fortunate.

The American e-commerce giant must stop allowing any customer ratings and reviews in China.

A negative review of Xis book prompted the demand, one of the people said. I think the issue was anything under five stars, the highest rating in Amazons five-point system, said the other person.

Ratings and reviews are a crucial part of Amazons e-commerce business, a major way of engaging shoppers. But Amazon complied, the two people said. Currently, on its Chinese site Amazon.cn, the government-published book has no customer reviews or any ratings. And the comments section is disabled.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

Amazons compliance with the Chinese government edict, which has not been reported before, is part of a deeper, decade-long effort by the company to win favor in Beijing to protect and grow its business in one of the worlds largest marketplaces.

An internal 2018 Amazon briefing document that describes the companys China business lays out a number of Core Issues the Seattle-based giant has faced in the country. Among them: Ideological control and propaganda is the core of the toolkit for the communist party to achieve and maintain its success, the document notes. We are not making judgement on whether it is right or wrong.

That briefing document, and interviews with more than two dozen people who have been involved in Amazons China operation, reveal how the company has survived and thrived in China by helping to further the ruling Communist Partys global economic and political agenda, while at times pushing back on some government demands.

In a core element of this strategy, the internal document and interviews show, Amazon partnered with an arm of Chinas propaganda apparatus to create a selling portal on the companys U.S. site, Amazon.com – a project that came to be known as China Books. The venture – which eventually offered more than 90,000 publications for sale – hasnt generated significant revenue. But the document shows that it was seen by Amazon as crucial to winning support in China as the company grew its Kindle electronic-book device, cloud-computing and e-commerce businesses.

The 2018 briefing document spells out the strategic stakes of the China Books project for Jay Carney, the global head of Amazons lobbying and public-policy operations, ahead of a trip he took to Beijing. Kindle has been operating in China in a policy grey area, the document stated, and noted that Amazon was having difficulty obtaining a license to sell e-books in the country.

The key element to safeguard against its license problem with the Chinese government is the Chinabooks project, the document stated.

The document also noted: Amazon.com/China books project has also gained wide recognition among Chinese regulators.

LIFE IN XINJIANG

The books include many apolitical titles, such as Chinese language textbooks, cookbooks and childrens bedtime stories. But they also include titles that amplify the Communist Partys official line.

One book extols life in Xinjiang, where United Nations experts have said China interned one million ethnic Uyghurs in a network of camps. The book – Incredible Xinjiang: Stories of Passion and Heritage – discusses an online comedy show situated in the region. The book quotes an actor who plays a Uyghur country bumpkin saying that ethnicity is not a problem there. That echoes the position of Beijing, which has denied mistreating minority groups.

Some books portray Chinas battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan, in heroic terms. One is titled Stories of Courage and Determination: Wuhan in Coronavirus Lockdown. Another begins with commentary from Xi: Our success to date has once again demonstrated the strengths of CPC (the Communist Party of China) leadership and Chinese socialism.

The state-owned firm that partners with Amazon on China books, China International Book Trading Corp, or CIBTC, told Reuters that the venture is a commercial relationship between two enterprises. Chinas National Press and Publication Administration, or NPPA, the state propaganda arm with which Amazon has had a partnership, had no comment.

In response to questions, Amazon said it complies with all applicable laws and regulations, wherever we operate, and China is no exception. It added that as a bookseller, we believe that providing access to the written word and diverse perspectives is important. That includes books that some may find objectionable.

Amazon said it has a wide selection of books on China, and the China Books portal is an additional channel for serving our Chinese readers in the United States and elsewhere. CIBTC is just one of the millions of selling partners around the world offering products in our stores.

Reuters News Agency provides news to China Central Television, the state-controlled broadcaster. The agency also distributes CCTV content via Reuters Connect, a marketplace that offers news from about 100 providers. The marketplace partnerships arent connected to the Reuters newsroom.

The new details about Amazons China strategy demonstrate the challenges Western companies face in accessing the worlds most populous market – and in coping with an authoritarian regime that has been tightening control over public discourse.

The companys compromises with Beijing contrast with its efforts to get around regulators in the worlds two largest democracies. In India, Reuters this year has documented how Amazon circumvented local regulations and, to promote its own brands, rigged search results on its Indian website. In the United States, Reuters detailed how Amazon gutted or killed state privacy bills designed to protect consumers.

Amazon said it has always complied with the law in India and doesnt favor its private-label products in search results. Regarding the United States, the company said it prefers U.S. federal privacy legislation, and that it protects consumers privacy and doesnt sell their data.

Some companies have responded to Beijings demands by leaving the market. Yahoo recently exited China and Microsoft Corps LinkedIn announced it would pull out some of its services. Both cited the countrys difficult business environment and regulatory requirements.

Amazon, by contrast, has grown into a powerful economic force in China in recent years, providing lucrative export opportunities to thousands of Chinese businesses while growing its own industry-leading cloud-services unit. Amazon Web Services, or AWS, is now one of the largest providers to Chinese companies globally, according to a report this year by analysis firm iResearch in China, and people who have worked for AWS.

Still, by 2018, Amazon was receiving an increasing number of requests from (Chinese) watchdogs to take down certain content, mostly politically sensitive ones, stated the briefing document prepared that year for Carney. He previously served as communications director for U.S. President Joe Biden, when Biden was vice president, and as press secretary for President Barack Obama.

Amazon declined to make Carney available for an interview.

According to the briefing document, the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC, asked Amazon in 2018 to take down a link to Chinas new blockbuster film Amazing China because of especially harsh user reviews. The CAC is responsible for online security and content regulation.

Amazing China praises the countrys accomplishments since Xi became president in 2013. CAC wanted the link removed from IMDb, an Amazon-owned website of movie information and reviews.

Amazons China office responded to CAC that it is difficult for Amazon China to accommodate such requests, and well relay the message to Amazon headquarters and seek their views about possibilities, the briefing document stated.

The film remains on IMDbs U.S. website. Shortly after the request, some negative reviews disappeared, archived screenshots of IMDb.com on archive.org show. Others remain, and Amazing China currently has an overall rating of just 2.3 out of a top score of 10. Some reviews call it pathetic, garbage or government propaganda.

Some reviews submitted for the title Amazing China were removed because they violated our user review content guidelines, with the majority being off topic, Amazon told Reuters. IMDb is not aware of any request from external parties (including the Chinese government) to do anything about reviews for this title.

CAC didnt respond to a request for comment.

WINK AND A NOD

Amazon entered China in 2004 through a $75 million deal to acquire Joyo.com, an online book-and-media seller. Eventually, Amazon wanted to introduce e-books and its popular Kindle reading devices to the Chinese market.

To accomplish that, it worked with the General Administration of Press and Publication, or GAPP, a regulator that engages in state censorship in its role as overseer of publications in China. NPPA now handles most of GAPPs responsibilities. NPPA, in turn, is overseen by the Communist Partys Publicity Department, which was previously known as the Propaganda Department.

According to a former Amazon executive involved in talks with China, the company secured some, but not all, of the government approvals it needed to sell Kindle devices and e-books. That situation gave the government leverage over the retailer, the former executive said. Amazons public-policy team came up with the China Books project as a novel way to get what we wanted on Kindle and other things, the person said. It was a wink and a nod.

Amazon soon began working with GAPP to set up China Books, according to the briefing document. The company planned to tout the portal to Chinese authorities as Amazons only store named after a country, the document said. Amazon dedicated several employees to the effort, which involved CIBTC, the government book-trading company, which the document described as the executing body from GAPP.

A photograph on CIBTCs website shows Chinese officials toasting the launch of the project at a hotel in Beijing in September 2011.

In October 2012, China Books was awarded the title, a key national culture export project, by a group of Chinese government bodies, including GAPP, as well as the entity now known as the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China. Two months later, Amazon launched its electronic-books business in China and soon began selling Kindles.

By the end of 2017, China had become Kindles largest global market, accounting for 40%+ of our world device sales volume, according to the 2018 briefing document. By then, Amazon had added a Chinese e-book store to its American website and had translated 19 books.

And Carney, the top public-policy executive who then reported to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, went to China in April 2018. There, he told an alternate member of the Communist Party central committee that Amazon would make every effort to promote China Books and make it bigger and stronger, according to a CIBTC press release.

The briefing document prepared for Carney stated: Both China Books and Kindle Chinese eBook Store are Amazon Chinas main commitment to assist China in Going Abroad, an umbrella project that aims to promote Chinese culture to the world.

Amazons China Books webpage prominently displays CIBTCs name, but doesnt disclose that its a project that Amazon created in a partnership with a Chinese government agency.

Details about the company are readily available online, Amazon told Reuters, and CIBTC has placed its name and logo prominently throughout its page. Our relationship with CIBTC is entirely appropriate.

Eventually, the China Books project flopped financially, according to a person who has been involved in it. Few of the portals titles have sold well, and Amazon even shipped back books because its warehouses lacked space for them.

An illustration shows books offered on Amazon.com, on a selling portal it created with Chinas government in what came to be known as the China Books project, taken December 14, 2021. REUTERS/Edgar Su/Illustration

Nonetheless, the China Books project continues. The Chinese-language version of Xi Jinping: The Governance of China Volume Three – is listed first on China Books BEST SELLER page. It recently showed a sales rank of 1,347,071. Another best seller, about COVID-19, was ranked 10,654,483. The Xinjiang title, which Reuters purchased, had been ranked 13,441,455.

But sales werent the goal, according to the person who has been involved in the project. Its a high-level photo-op, part of a soft-power campaign to basically put the books out there and just have it be visible.

In its statement to Reuters, CIBTC, the government book-trading company, said it doesnt rank books sold through Amazon. It didnt elaborate.

A THREAT TO RETALIATE

Amazon continued its Chinese expansion in 2013, announcing the introduction in Beijing of Amazon Web Services, its cloud-computing business. At the time, no Chinese law regulated cloud services, the 2018 briefing document noted.

In 2016, China began taking actions that made it more difficult for foreign cloud-computing firms, such as AWS, to operate in the country.

The government began requiring cloud providers to hold a new license that only Chinese-owned companies could obtain, according to the briefing document. Regulators have since become very hostile toward AWS, the 2018 document stated.

The result was that Amazon took an unusual step for the company: It handed off its cloud technology to local companies so it could keep operating in China. The Chinese companies – not Amazon – were responsible for monitoring and taking down illegal content, collecting and reporting basic information of customers … and working with PRC (the Peoples Republic of China) authorities on all compliance-related inquiries that may arise, the 2018 document stated.

In its statement to Reuters, Amazon said that AWS, as a foreign cloud provider, has to license or sell technology to local partners in China in order to have a presence there.

That structure didnt shield AWS from Chinese pressure, however.

In February 2018, Chinas Ministry of Public Security, or MPS, called AWS to a meeting, the briefing document stated. MPS threatened to retaliate against Amazon unless it removed content and blocked a website it hosted in the United States for Guo Wengui, a Chinese dissident. AWS refused, the document said. But the company asked Guo to take an action that exposed the dissidents Internet Protocol, or IP address, and AWS provided to MPS this data, the document stated. An IP address is a unique code that identifies a computer accessing the internet.

The ministry recognized our effort to find a solution, though not ... to their satisfactory level, the document stated.

The 2018 briefing document advised Carney to raise the governments request on Guo when meeting a top Ministry of Commerce official in Beijing, and stress that China shouldnt make requests that involve data stored abroad.

Asked about the Guo incident, Amazon confirmed it received the Chinese governments request, but said it did not provide any non-public information or any other customer information.

The commerce ministry said Guo wasnt discussed at the meeting with Carney. Amazon didnt say whether Guo came up.

An employee for MPS said the ministry doesnt respond to requests for comment. An attorney for Guo said Guo had no comment.

AWSs China business continues to grow. Despite being blocked from selling cloud services to the government and some state-owned enterprises, AWS has landed key customers in China, say people familiar with the matter.

Among them are two Chinese companies, Tiktok developer ByteDance and video-surveillance firm Hikvision, as well as multinationals Nike, Samsung and Philips, according to the 2018 briefing document and a 2019 blog on AWSs website. Philips declined to comment; the other four companies didnt respond to requests for comment.

In June, AWS announced it was expanding further in the country, to support the demands of our growing customer base in China.

Summary Pfizer sees pandemic extending into 2024

Pfizer says it is studying a three-dose regimen

European countries gear up for more restrictions

MADRID/DUBLIN, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Friday the COVID-19 pandemic could extend through next year and announced plans to develop a three-dose vaccine regimen for children ages 2 to 16, a move that could delay its authorisation.

The U.S. pharmaceutical company made its comments as European countries geared up for further travel and social restrictions and a study warned that the rapidly spreading Omicron coronavirus variant was five times more likely to reinfect people than its predecessor, Delta.

Pfizer executives said the company believed that by 2024, the disease should be endemic around the globe, meaning it would no longer be a pandemic. The company projected that COVID will transition to an endemic state potentially by 2024.

Prior to the Omicron variant, top U.S. disease doctor Anthony Fauci forecast the pandemic would end in 2022 in the United States.

Announcing plans to develop a three-dose regimen for ages 2 to 16, Chief Scientific Officer Mikael Dolsten told a conference call that results of three doses among people older than 16 showed that approach offered greater protection.

Therefore, we have decided to modify each of the pediatric studies to incorporate a third dose to the series and seek licensure for a three-dose series rather than a two-dose series as originally anticipated, the company said.

Pfizer developed its COVID-19 vaccine with Germanys BioNTech SE (22UAy.DE). The companies have been developing a version of their vaccine tailored to combat the Omicron variant, but have not decided whether it will be needed. They expect to start a clinical trial for the updated vaccine in January, the Pfizer executives said.

The risk of reinfection with the Omicron variant is 5.4 times higher and it shows no sign of being milder than the Delta variant, a study by Imperial College London found, as cases soar across Europe and threaten year-end festivities.

Past infection may offer as little as 19% protection against reinfection by the new variant, Imperial College said, noting that the study of hundreds of thousands of cases, including 1,846 confirmed as Omicron, had not been peer reviewed.

MOVES TOWARDS MORE RESTRICTIONS

The new findings may add urgency to countries efforts to speed up vaccination booster campaigns to try to diminish the burden on hospitals and health systems. So far, a spike in infections in Britain and elsewhere in Europe has not led to a big jump in hospitalizations or deaths. read more

Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and Denmark were all moving toward further travel restrictions, following the footsteps of France, which closed its borders this week to most non-resident Britons.

Switzerland will from Monday until Jan. 24 expand the requirement to show proof of vaccination or recovery from the coronavirus in order to access indoor venues like restaurants, while discos and bars will require a negative test result.

With the new variant accounting for a fifth of daily cases, the Danish government proposed closing theatres, cinemas, entertainment parks and conference centres, as well as limiting large crowds in stores and shops just seven days before Christmas Eve. read more

RISING DEATH TOLL

Since the coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China almost two years ago, more than 5 million people have died of COVID-19 globally and more than 272 million cases have been reported.

More than 8.5 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered worldwide - an effort now complicated by Omicrons emergence.

The variant has driven infections in Britain close to peak levels seen in early 2021, although hospitalisations and deaths remain much lower. European countries and the United States have also seen infections spike in December.

European Union governments have agreed to order over 180 million doses of the adapted version of the vaccine being developed by BioNTech and Pfizer, the head of the EU executive body, the European Commission, said. read more

Draghi has never sought to dampen talk that he wants to become president, but Salvini became the latest of several party chiefs to suggest it would be better for Italys political stability for him to carry on as head of government.

ZURICH, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Switzerland laid out new proposals on Friday for a law to halve its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, pushing ahead with a carbon dioxide tax although eschewing controversial measures to impose levies on flights and car fuel.

The government had to go back to the drawing board after Swiss voters in June rejected its initial plans. read more

The government proposed maintaining its tax on fossil fuels such as oil and gas of 120 Swiss francs ($130) per tonne of carbon dioxide, while providing companies with an out if they commit to reducing emissions to zero eventually.

The proposal would limit the amount importers, who will be required to offset some emissions, can pass to customers at the fuel pumps to 5 Swiss cents per litre of diesel or benzene.

To promote eco-friendly transport, the government said it would use CO2 taxes to help finance new electric vehicle charging stations, while charging dealers for importing less efficient cars.

The government said it planned to spend 25 million-30 million Swiss francs annually to foster innovations in renewable jet fuel, while requiring airlines to mix fuels from renewable sources into their kerosene when tanking up in Switzerland, as done in the European Union.

Under the plan released for public comment until April, two-thirds of the targeted 50% emissions reduction by 2030 should be achieved domestically, with the rest via climate protection efforts abroad, the government said.

The Climate Action Tracker, which bills itself as a provider of independent scientific analysis measuring government action against targets under the globally agreed Paris Agreement, rated Switzerland insufficient overall as of mid-September.

NEW YORK, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserves more hawkish turn this week came amid heightened worries about economic recovery and inflation, but it has barely changed the bond markets view that short-term interest rates could top out below the U.S. central banks estimated peak.

Current betting even has rates staying below the inflation level the Fed projected over the next few years.

Since the Federal Open Market Committee released its policy statement Wednesday, markets have priced the terminal rate where policy rates will stop going up, at between 1.4% to 1.7%, according to eurodollar futures view of U.S. rates in three years .

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

The Fed does not forecast a terminal rate, but the markets expectation of when the current hiking cycle will peak is well below the U.S. central banks view of 2.5%, and lower still than the revised core inflation estimate of 2.6% next year.

The Feds neutral rate has been 2.5% for a couple of years after trending down from the time they first introduced its summary of economic projections. That rate is down 1 basis point in the last six years.

The market is penciling in a potential policy mistake by the Fed, wherein it hikes rates too aggressively near term and is unable to hike past 1.4%, said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates strategist, at TD Securities in New York.

The recent price action is indicative of worries that Omicron will set back the recovery and will allow the Fed to moderate rate hikes, he added, referring to the highly-transmissible coronavirus variant.

On Wednesday, the Fed flagged three interest rate increases in 2022 and another three in 2023, with the policy rate climbing to 2.1% in 2024.

The Fed typically lifts its benchmark rate higher until the economy is able to run on its own without any monetary policy action, typically hitting or exceeding what is known as the equilibrium rate.

The previous Fed rate hike cycle in 2018 peaked at 2.25%-2.5%.

The Fed waited too long, certainly in our opinion, to wait for inflation to get here and fight it, said David Petrosinelli, managing director and senior trader at broker-dealer InspereX in New York.

Because theyre running behind on inflation, the Fed has to raise rates faster with more rate increases front-loaded in 2022. The fear is that this is going to slow down the economy.

The U.S. Treasury yield curve typically bear flattens as the Fed shifts toward tightening, with smaller rises in long-term than in short-term yields. But recently, long-term U.S. Treasury yields have dropped from already very low levels, implying the historically low Fed terminal rate.

Perhaps this outcome reflects the limits to how much the Fed can tighten in a heavily-indebted, pandemic world, said R.J. Gallo, senior portfolio manager at Federated Hermes with assets under management.

DECLINING BOND YIELDS

The decline U.S. long-term yields has baffled market participants given a backdrop of persistent inflation pressure, stronger and tighter labor market, as well the Feds tapering of its bond buying.

Jonathan Cohen, head of rates trading strategy at Credit Suisse in New York, said the decline in yields could be attributed, in part, to supply-demand factors, which include rapid buying of U.S. Treasuries by banks, the reduction in available supply even after accounting for Fed tapering, and the de-risking of pension funds as they gravitate toward bonds.

Since late November, U.S. 10-year yields have declined by more than 30 basis points and was last down at 1.397% . U.S. 30-year yields, meanwhile, have fallen more than 20 basis points and last traded at 1.824%.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday though that hes not too troubled about where the long bond is.

Its not surprising that theres a lot of demand for U.S. sovereigns in a world ... a risk-free world ... where theyre yielding so much more than Bunds or JGBs (Japanese government bond, Powell added.

Still, some analysts believe the terminal rate is way too low and may well end up higher than what markets expected.

The risks to the hiking cycle are numerous. But it is important to stress they are just that – namely, risks – and it seems strange for the Fed and markets to be positioned for a risk scenario, said Andrea Cicione, head of strategy at TS Lombard.

In our view, it is more likely that the Fed and markets will move toward the economic reality once risks fail to materialize.

WASHINGTON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - It took an unemployment rate nosediving below 4%, years into the last U.S. economic recovery, to raise the countrys labor force participation rate, and Federal Reserve officials are banking on a similar response in new projections that couple a renewed fight against inflation with a historic run of low joblessness.

Its an outlook that has struck some analysts as contradictory - unemployment sitting at 3.5% for several years might be expected to raise price pressures - but it is consistent with recent research showing a long lag between rising employment and an eventual increase in labor supply and participation rates.

Fed officials expected a participation rebound would happen fast this time. So far it hasnt.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

But it appears wired into the U.S. central banks latest economic projections, which were released on Wednesday, and is what allows low unemployment to develop alongside falling inflation and a policy interest rate that over coming years remains below the level that would actually restrict economic activity.

Its a scenario that seems to involve the Fed still viewing inflation as transitory even though that word disappeared from this weeks policy statement, and anticipating labor supply will improve and help keep prices at bay, said Vincent Reinhart, a former top Fed staffer and now the chief economist at Dreyfus & Mellon.

Even though they no longer use the word transitory, they believe it ... This is not a policy path that brings inflation down. It is one that observes inflation coming down, he said.

Given the low unemployment rate and projected slowdown in inflation, Reinhart said Fed officials also appear to expect labor force participation is increasing and getting back to pre-pandemic levels, with the additional flow of workers helping moderate wage and price increases.

On the surface, the Feds Dec. 14-15 policy meeting reflected a hawkish turn towards higher interest rates - it signaled three rate hikes were coming in 2022 - in a shift that could also be read as the central bank abandoning its promise of maximum employment in order to slow the economy and tame price increases currently running at twice the Feds 2% target.

In his post-meeting news conference on Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell bluntly acknowledged that he had been surprised by the level and persistence of inflation this year.

Fed officials planned to court higher inflation to offset years when it was below their target. The inflation they got, however, nearly closed a decade of misses in one quick jump.

Reuters Graphics

LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION

But Powell was also clear on another point: The current bout of price increases is different than what was expected and is being driven by dislocations still linked to the coronavirus pandemic.

Though it was proving more difficult and taking longer, those problems still should be resolved over time, he said.

One of the issues is the labor force participation rate, which fell more than three percentage points at the start of the pandemic, from 63.4% to 60.2%, before rebounding quickly through the first summer of the health crisis.

Then it stalled just below 62%, leaving the workforce still around 1.6 million people shy of the pre-pandemic peak.

Those former workers may have retired. They may be waiting on better health conditions. They may be waiting on child care.

But a study presented at the Feds premier research conference this year by Bart Hobijn, an economist who has worked at the New York Fed and San Francisco Fed and teaches at Arizona State University, and Aysegul Sahin, an economics professor at the University of Texas at Austin, documented that the participation cycle wasnt driven by workers reentering from the sidelines of the labor market, but by those already participating choosing to stick it out through spells of unemployment and continuing to look for work.

Reuters Graphics

It took much longer, Hobijn and Sahin noted, for that rising labor market attachment to be reflected in the participation rate than it did for the unemployment rate to fall. The lag, they said, could be substantial this time because of the complicating health and childcare issues.

Rising participation was one of the forces Fed officials said helped the economy during the last, decade-long recovery to reach a hoped-for state where the unemployment rate was low, wages increased, and yet inflation remained tame.

Along with their move against inflation this week, Fed officials projected the U.S. will move back to that sort of optimal state, locking into a 3.5% unemployment rate that, since the 1950s, has only been hit about 15% of the time.

Reuters Graphics

To get back to where we were, the evidence grows that it is going to take some time. And what we need is another long expansion, Powell told reporters on Wednesday. Weve had a shock to labor force participation that is not unwinding as quickly as many had expected ... We would all ... expect that the level of maximum employment thats consistent with price stability would increase further over time, for example, through increasing participation.

MSCIs gauge of stocks across the globe (.MIWD00000PUS) shed 0.84%.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 531.08 points, or 1.48%, to 35,366.56, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 48.12 points, or 1.03%, to 4,620.55, and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 10.75 points, or 0.07%, to 15,169.68.

U.S. stocks have reversed all of their gains from Wednesday, when markets welcomed the Federal Reserves commitment to tackle rising inflation with faster bond tapering and interest rate hikes next year.

The hawkish tilt from central banks this week, including the Fed and the Bank of England and to a lesser degree the European Central Bank, was initially greeted by a wave of buying from investors confident policymakers would curb higher inflation.

But the mood has turned gloomier as traders fret that markets pumped up on cheap money are vulnerable to even the smallest of pullbacks in stimulus.

Volatility is rising again, lowering the predictability of what may happen next, said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote.

The Bank of Japan dialed back some emergency pandemic funding on Friday but maintained its ultra-loose policy and extended financial relief for small firms, cementing expectations it will remain among the most dovish central banks for the foreseeable future. read more

Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 5/32 in price to yield 1.4072%, from 1.422% late on Thursday. The dollar index rose 0.728%.

Adding to the caution are worries that rising Omicron infection rates mean a rocky few months for the global economy, although most economists think the damage will be much less severe than in previous waves of COVID-19 cases.

Ordinarily, in the wake of a more hawkish (Fed) outcome, yields would be expected to rise in anticipation of the Fed tightening cycle, said analysts at Westpac.

However, there are competing dynamics at present, with ongoing inflation fears sparking the Feds tougher rhetoric being offset by fears that economic growth will be derailed by Omicron in the near term, they added.

The firms actions meaningfully impacted the SECs ability to investigate potential violations of the federal securities laws, the SEC said.

JPMorgan declined to comment.

The penalty is one of the first major enforcement actions brought under SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden and who has pledged to crack down on misconduct by Wall Street companies.

The SEC said it discovered that J.P. Morgan Securities had been violating rules that require firms to preserve written business communications when the broker was unable to produce records during the course of other investigations.

As a result of the JPMorgan probe, the SEC has opened investigations into other firms records-keeping practices, it said, confirming an October Reuters report.

This is an issue that were seeing at other firms, said an SEC official, adding that individuals and entities that self-report will fare better in penalty negotiations.

From at least January 2018 through November 2020, J.P. Morgan Securities employees often communicated about securities business matters on their personal devices, using text messages, WhatsApp, and personal email accounts, the SEC said.

None of these records were preserved. The lapses were institution-wide and known to senior management, who also used personal devices to discuss business matters, the SEC said.

It added that J.P. Morgan Securities agreed to retain a compliance consultant and to conduct a comprehensive review of its policies and procedures relating to the retention of electronic communications found on personal devices, among other remedies.

PARIS, Dec 17 (Reuters) - A Paris judge approved a 10 million euro ($11.27 million) settlement with LVMH (LVMH.PA) on Friday that closes a criminal probe into the luxury group’s role in a spying case involving the former top boss of France’s security services.

With the agreement, the worlds largest luxury group and owner of the Louis Vuitton and Dior fashion houses, avoids a public trial that could have aired details of work undertaken by former domestic intelligence services head Bernard Squarcini.

Squarcini, who was hired by the luxury goods giant in 2013 is supected of drawing on his influence to collect classified information and notably of spying on activist journalist Francois Ruffin, according to court documents.

In 2016, Ruffin produced a documentary film called Merci Patron that put the spotlight on LVMH boss Bernard Arnault, following a family that lost their jobs at a supplier to the group.

The former intelligence chief, who served as a consultant for the luxury group for several years, is under investigation for influence peddling, illegally collecting information on private individuals and violating privacy laws.

A lawyer for Squarcini, who has previously denied any wrongdoing, declined to comment on Friday.

The Paris public prosecutors office said the agreement was an efficient means of sanctioning acts prohibited under penal law, that were proven by the company to have ceased.

LVMHs acceptance of the agreement does not imply admission of guilt or a judgement against the company, said Caroline Viguier, a judge at the the Paris court Friday.

The settlement reflects acknowledgement of past shortcomings, that belong to the past, said LVMH lawyer Jacqueline Laffont, speaking in a hearing before the decision was announced.

Dec 17 (Reuters) - Californias civil rights regulator is investigating Googles treatment of Black female workers following alleged incidents of harassment and discrimination, according to two people familiar with the matter and emails from the agency seen by Reuters.

Attorneys and analysts at the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) have repeatedly interviewed several Black women who have worked at the Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) company about their experiences there, according to the documents and the sources. The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing the work.

Questions have centered on alleged harassment and discrimination in the workplace, according to the emails. Conversations have taken place as recently as last month, one of the sources said.

The DFEH declined to comment.

Google said it is focused on building sustainable equity for its Black workers and that 2020 was its largest year for hiring what it calls Black+ workers, a designation inclusive of people belonging to multiple races.

Our goal is to ensure that every employee experiences Google as an inclusive workplace, it said. We’ll continue to focus on this important work and thoroughly investigate any concerns, to make sure our workplace is representative and equitable.

The DFEH has interviewed workers who have filed formal complaints and those who have not, the people said, showing that the regulator has sought more examples of potential mistreatment.

The agency is involved in ongoing lawsuits against video game companies Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) Riot Games and Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O) alleging widespread discrimination and harassment.

But its cases do not always result in charges.

For years Black men in the tech industry have said they have faced disparaging comments and discouraging experiences, such as being shut out of offices because security guards and colleagues questioned whether they actually worked there.

As more Black women have joined the workforce, such complaints have increased. Seven current and former Google employees told Reuters this year about being marginalized on projects as Black women and not taken as seriously as colleagues with different backgrounds.

Artificial intelligence researcher Timnit Gebru has said Google fired her a year ago for criticizing its lack of workforce diversity and for fighting managers who objected to publishing a critical paper she co-wrote. Erika Munro Kennerly, who oversaw diversity and strategy teams at Google before resigning last year, told magazine Corporate Counsel in January that theres an overall tone of being undervalued as a Black woman at Google.

Workers identifying as Black+ female left Google at the highest rate of any racial-gender group other than Native American+ female last year, according to company data. Google last year said it planned to boost retention by increasing support staffing and programs. read more

Northvolt goes all out to meet 2021 launch goal', 2021, 'Reuters', 'https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/batteries-included-northvolt-goes-all-out-meet-2021-launch-goal-2021-12-17/', 'STOCKHOLM, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Northvolt Chief Executive Peter Carlsson wants to take on his old boss Elon Musk with the greenest electric vehicle batteries in the world. But he needs to start producing them first.

The Swede is determined to get his factory, roughly 200 km south of the Arctic circle, open for business this month, meaning he and his team of engineers and technicians are labouring at a pace that would rival Santas little helpers.

We are working extremely intensely right now to keep that schedule, and even if it means the first battery is made on New Years Eve, its going out this year, Carlsson told Reuters.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

The lithium-ion plant was the first to be built in the European Union by a European company and it is meant to be the launchpad for a regional battery champion that can compete not only with Tesla but also Asian suppliers including Panasonic (6752.T), LG Chem (051910.KS), and CATL (300750.SZ).

Northvolt has raised more than $6.5 billion in funding from the likes of Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), the European Commission and Spotify founder Daniel Ek as well as contracts worth over $27 billion from automakers.

It plans to produce enough batteries to power over 1 million electric vehicles (EV) annually in its Swedish plant in the former gold mining town of Skelleftea, and later supply to other sectors switching to electric, such as industrial machinery and ferries.

Carlsson aims to open at least two more factories in the next ten years.

A former head of production and supply chain at Tesla, which he left in 2015, Carlsson is hoping his experience working with Musk to scale up the billionaires California factory will help him in the snowy reaches of northern Sweden.

During my years at Tesla with Elon I got to know how fun it is to build and scale, and also how very challenging, Carlsson said.

There is always supply chain issues when you are starting to scale ... I think this is something we are going to be very, very focused on during the next two years.

Recalls of EV batteries from some of the biggest producers have shown how demanding it is to produce batteries on a large scale, coupled with setting up an extremely complex supply chain with both corporate and geopolitical risks.

To get that (product quality) right while scaling production for the first time is obviously a huge challenge, said Hans Eric Melin, founder of London-based consultancy Circular Energy Storage.

GREEN CREDENTIALS

Northvolt currently employs about 2,500 people from 108 countries, and plans to add 5,000 more engineers over the next five years.

Northvolt and Volvo Cars (VOLCARb.ST), which aims to go fully electric by 2030, are due to announce a location in Europe for a joint gigafactory early next year.

We could make our own batteries and start from zero, Volvo CEO Hakan Samuelsson said in an interview. But I dont think that would be efficient enough.

Competition for talent is fierce. Most of the battery engineers are based in Asia and Asian suppliers such as LG and Samsung SDI are setting up factories in Europe. Other startups are also trying to get a foothold.

Tesla is looking to recruit for its gigafactory in Berlin.

Skelleftea -- pronounced like she left you -- cant compete with the German capitals club scene and its climate can be foreboding with snow cover from November to April and only a few hours of sunshine during the winter.

But Carlsson is banking on the green credentials of the city and the plant to attract engineers. Skelleftea runs largely on renewable energy from hydropower and wind and the plant will be 100% renewable. Batteries will also be recycled there.

As we go into new generations of skill and talent, a paycheck is not enough, they want purpose, they want to be part of a mission, he said.

Money is still important, however, with every employee being offered a slice of the company in the form of an equity stake as part of their salary package.

And Northvolt is setting up an entire ecosystem to accommodate staff from as far away as South Korea, Japan and India with housing and company-sponsored social activities including ice hockey and cross-country skiing. It plans to run electric helicopters between Skelleftea airport and the plant underway.

To fulfil Northvolts expansion plan, the company needs regular infusions of money.

The $6.5 billion in funding already raised will not be enough, according to Carlsson.

Northvolt is aiming for the Skelleftea plant to achieve production capacity of 60 gigawatt hours - that could power up to 1 million cars per year depending on battery size - as it wants to grab at least a 20-25% market share in Europe by 2030.

Last week, Volvo Cars and Northvolt said they will open a joint research and development centre in Sweden as part of a $3.3 billion investment. read more

Melin, the consultant, said Northvolt could well reach its production and market share targets.

With tailwinds, secured supply of raw materials and a well-positioned product mix I cant see what could stop them. But those are big ifs, he said.

MOSCOW, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Tatyana Bakalchuk is a rarity – a dotcom billionaire uninterested in outside capital or a stock market listing.

The founder of Wildberries, Russias largest ecommerce retailer, has made it to the top of Forbes list of Russias richest women without any help from external investors, and plans to keep it that way.

Speaking to Reuters via videolink from her home in the Moscow suburbs, Bakalchuk, a mother of seven and former teacher who founded her firm while on maternity leave in 2004, said a long-resisted move to go public was still not part of its plans.

Banks that come to us say - please, understand that now is the most favourable time for an IPO, because this will be the cheapest money raised. They believe that in two years, most likely, this euphoria will pass, Bakalchuk said.

Everything can happen in this life, but this is not yet in our strategy.

The retailer, which started out as an online platform reselling clothes from the likes of German mail order group Otto and now supplies everything from electronics to kitchenware, is even less likely to part with a stake to a strategic investor, she said.

This is a 100% no. If there is a ghostly hope for the IPO... then attracting an investor is definitely a no, Bakalchuk, who owns 99% of the company, said.

The strategy is in sharp contrast to peer Ozon (OZON.O), which debuted on the U.S. Nasdaq last year, and other big Russian tech firms like Yandex (YNDX.O).

With almost one in three Russians using its service, Wildberries is still the clear market leader, pulling in more than double the sales of its nearest rival Ozon last year, according to Statista.

In 2021 it expects an almost fivefold jump in net profit to 10 billion roubles ($136 million) from 2.1 billion roubles in 2020, Bakalchuk said, and a rise in gross merchandise volume to more than 800 billion roubles, a record level. Debt stands at 35 billion roubles.

Bakalchuk declined to be drawn on the threat from competition, saying on the firm was constantly competing with ourselves. Present in 19 countries, with Britain just added, it aims to expand into two more next month, she said.

It also plans to expand its logistics network in Kazakhstan, Armenia and Belarus, and to at some point enter Uzbekistan - a very promising market.

Building up at home is also a focus. E-commerce penetration in Russia, where logistics and poor infrastructure pose big challenges, has been growing fast of late but is still much lower compared to markets such as Britain or the United States.

There is a need to carry out more intensive work on existing projects, Bakalchuk, who Forbes estimates holds assets worth $13 billion, said. We want to strengthen our work with local entrepreneurs.

Dec 17 (Reuters) - Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN.O) shares skidded nearly 15% on Friday to hit a record low after the electric vehicle makers first result as a listed company highlighted the challenges it was likely to face in ramping up production to take on EV leader Tesla Inc (TSLA.O).

Rivians shares slumped to $92.62 in early trading - opening below the $100 mark for the first time -and were still off about 11% in the afternoon. Before Fridays decline, they had gained about 40% since the companys blockbuster market debut in November.

Rivian announced plans on Thursday to build a $5 billion plant in Georgia to boost capacity, while flagging production challenges even as it receives about 2,000 pre-orders every week. read more

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

We dont want to read too much into near-term issues ... but it does highlight the risk that Rivian has a lot on its plate, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak.

The Irvine, California-based company expects production to fall a few hundred vehicles short of its 2021 target of 1,200 due to supply chain constraints.

Increasing production of the R1T truck, R1S SUV and Amazons delivery vans within a few months would be akin to a really complex orchestra, Chief Executive Officer RJ Scaringe said.

Rivian has 71,000 pre-orders for its R1 vehicles, up from 55,400 in October, but some on Wall Street said that total is on the low end of expectations. Rivian also has struggled to get the vehicles into customers hands.

The strong order book provides support for the production ramp, though it does add pressure to get vehicles to customers that may get impatient as current R1 orders wont be ready until the end of 2023, Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan said.

Construction of Rivians new Georgia plant will begin next summer and vehicle production will start in 2024. The company plans to increase production by 50,000 vehicles at its plant in Normal, Illinois, which began building the R1T pickup in September and added the R1S SUV this week with the delivery van to follow this month.

Rivian faces fresh challenges in building volume as demand rises while squashing doubts on whether a new electric vehicle company will be able to survive what Tesla CEO Elon Musk has called production hell.

Soon after Rivians IPO, Musk said that high production and breakeven cash flow would be the true test for Rivian. read more

Georgia economic development officials on Friday declined to say what the incentives for Rivian will total as they are still being finalized. Georgia previously gave Korean automaker Kia more than $450 million in incentives for a new plant in the state, according to some reports, and officials in Texas offered Rivian up to $440 million for the new plant. read more

It is a snapshot of an ambitious new Boeing strategy to unify sprawling design, production and airline services operations under a single digital ecosystem - in as little as two years.

Critics say Boeing has repeatedly made similar bold pledges on a digital revolution, with mixed results. But insiders say the overarching goals of improving quality and safety have taken on greater urgency and significance as the company tackles multiple threats.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

The planemaker is entering 2022 fighting to reassert its engineering dominance after the 737 MAX crisis, while laying the foundation for a future aircraft program over the next decade - a $15 billion gamble. It also aims to prevent future manufacturing problems like the structural flaws that have waylaid its 787 Dreamliner over the past year. read more

Its about strengthening engineering, Boeings chief engineer, Greg Hyslop, told Reuters in his first interview in nearly two years. We are talking about changing the way we work across the entire company.

After years of wild market competition, the need to deliver on bulging order books has opened up a new front in Boeings war with Europes Airbus (AIR.PA), this time on the factory floor.

Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury, a former automobile research boss, has pledged to invent new production systems and leverage the power of data to optimize its industrial system.

Boeings approach so far has been marked by incremental advances within specific jet programs or tooling, rather than the systemic overhaul that characterizes Hyslops push today.

The simultaneous push by both plane giants is emblematic of a digital revolution happening globally, as automakers like Ford Motor Co (F.N) and social media companies like Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) shift work and play into an immersive virtual world sometimes called the metaverse.

So how does the metaverse - a shared digital space often using virtual reality or augmented reality and accessible via the internet - work in aviation?

Like Airbus, Boeings holy grail for its next new aircraft is to build and link virtual three-dimensional digital twin replicas of the jet and the production system able to run simulations.

The digital mockups are backed by a digital thread that stitches together every piece of information about the aircraft from its infancy - from airline requirements, to millions of parts, to thousands of pages of certification documents - extending deep into the supply chain.

Overhauling antiquated paper-based practices could bring powerful change.

More than 70% of quality issues at Boeing trace back to some kind of design issue, Hyslop said. Boeing believes such tools will be central to bringing a new aircraft from inception to market in as little as four or five years.

You will get speed, you will get improved quality, better communication, and better responsiveness when issues occur, Hyslop said.

When the quality from the supply base is better, when the airplane build goes together more smoothly, when you minimize re-work, the financial performance will follow from that.

ENORMOUS CHALLENGE

Yet the plan faces enormous challenges.

Skeptics point to technical problems on Boeings 777X mini-jumbo and T-7A RedHawk military training jet, which were developed using digital tools.

Boeing has also placed too great an emphasis on shareholder returns at the expense of engineering dominance, and continues to cut R&D spending, Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia said.

Is it worth pursuing? By all means, Aboulafia said. Will it solve all their problems? No.

Juggernauts like aircraft parts maker Spirit AeroSystems (SPR.N) have already invested in digital technology. Major planemakers have partnerships with French software maker Dassault Systèmes (DAST.PA). But hundreds of smaller suppliers spread globally lack the capital or human resources to make big leaps.

Many have been weakened by the MAX and coronavirus crises, which followed a decade of price pressure from Boeing or Airbus.

They not only tell us what hardware we can buy, they are now going to specify all this fancy digital junk that goes on top of it? one supply chain executive said.

A LONG GAME

Boeing itself has come to realize that digital technology alone is not a panacea. It must come with organizational and cultural changes across the company, industry sources say.

Boeing recently tapped veteran engineer Linda Hapgood to oversee the digital transformation, which one industry source said was underpinned by more than 100 engineers.

Hapgood is best known for turning black-and-white paper drawings of the 767 tankers wiring bundles into 3-D images, and then outfitting mechanics with tablets and HoloLens augmented-reality headsets. Quality improved by 90%, one insider said.

In her new role, Hapgood hired engineers who worked on a digital twin for a now-scrapped midmarket airplane known as NMA.

She is also drawing on lessons learned from the MQ-25 aerial refueling drone and the T-7A Red Hawk.

Boeing built the first T-7A jets in simulation, following a model-based design. The T-7A was brought to market in just 36 months.

Even so, the program is grappling with parts shortages, design delays and additional testing requirements.

Boeing has a running start with its 777X wing factory in Washington state, where the layout and robot optimization was first done digitally. But the broader program is years behind schedule and mired in certification challenges.

This is a long game, Hyslop said. Every one of these efforts was addressing part of the problem. But now what we want to do is do it from end to end.

The numbers are staggering. Global stocks have piled on more than $10 trillion, bonds have been on fire, oil has surged almost 25%, former crisis spots Greece and Ukraine have top-performed, and even gold has sparkled.

Wall Street .SPX and MSCIs near 50-country world index .MIWD00000PUS have both stormed to record highs after 30% and 24% leaps. Europe, Japan, China and Brazil are all up at least 20% in dollar terms too. Not exactly shoddy.

A mirror image of 2018, when almost everything fell? Perhaps. But there have been a couple of important drivers.

One was China showing it was serious about stimulus for its $14 trillion economy. The other was the screeching change of direction by the world’s top central banks, led by the Federal Reserve, which cut U.S. interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis more than a decade earlier.

“Whereas a year ago the Fed was raising rates and earnings were rolling over, this year you have felt the Fed has been on your side,” said James Clunie, who manages asset firm Jupiter’s Absolute Return Fund.

“They are willing to do QE4 at a stock market (record) high, which is extraordinary,” he added, referring to Fed efforts to bring down a spike in money market rates that some suggest could presage a fourth round of quantitative easing asset purchases.

Graphic: Global markets in 2019 -

That Fed shift and the worldwide blizzard of rate cuts that have come since have fired bond markets up like a rocket.

U.S. Treasuries, the world’s benchmark government IOU, have made a whopping 9.4 percent after yields plunged as much as 120 basis points. That followed a near 40 basis point fall the last quarter of 2018, after five quarters in which they had consistently risen.

German Bunds -- Europe’s safest asset -- have had their best year in five years, making roughly 5.5% in euro terms as the European Central Bank has reversed course too. The yield on 10-year debt dropped below zero percent for the first time since 2016 in March and dived as deep as -0.74% in September.

Graphic: U.S. Treasuries vs German Bunds -

In commodities, oil has raced up almost 25% following its best first quarter since 2009. That, plus key dividend rule changes, has made Russia’s stock market the best in the world with a 40% rise and also made the rouble a top three currency.

Metals have had a more mixed time. Copper is only 4% higher after buckling badly when trade tensions flared in the middle of the year, and aluminum is down 2%. But palladium, used in car and truck catalytic converters, has boomed 55%, while gold has had its best year since 2010 with a 15% jump.

A statistic likely to make most jaws drop is that Greek banks -- remember all that euro debt crisis and capital controls stuff a few years back? -- have been some of the world’s best-performing stocks this year.

The countrys biggest lender Piraeus Bank BOPr.AT is up 250%, as is smaller Attica Bank BOAr.AT, helping make Athens Europes strongest bourse this year.

But even those gains look skimpy in comparison to Californian video streaming darling Roko ROKU.O, whose shares have risen 440% this year.

FANGTASTIC

Tech has remained top more broadly. Apple AAPL.O may just have lost its crown as worlds most valuable firm to Saudi Aramco but it can console itself with its 77% leap this year.

Facebook FB.O has surged 57%, Microsoft MSFT.O 53%, Google GOOGL.O 30%, Netflix NFLX.O 24% and Amazon AMZN.O 19 percent. Chinas tech sector .CSIINT is right in mix too with a 64% rally and online behemoth Alibaba BABA.K up 53%.

Cryptoassets have been typically wild. Bitcoin was up over up 260% in June but it has been hauled back to around 85%.

Riskier high-yield debt, corporate bonds and local currency emerging market bonds and have all brought in between 11%-14% while Ukraine’s dollar bonds and Greece’s euro bonds have piled on over 30%.

“It is just a great year for the asset class,” said Pictet emerging market debt portfolio manager Guido Chamorro.

“It has been a relentless rally across the board over the last couple of months and it is possible that it continues into next year.”

Graphic: Emerging market hard currency bonds in 2019 -

Despite almost daily Brexit chaos, the loss of another prime minister and a snap election, UK gilts have returned 4.5% and a near 6% rise could land sterling its best quarter since 2009.

In contrast, the Feds pirouette and easing of trade tensions means the dollar index .DXY is about to experience its worst quarter in 1-1/2 years. It is still clinging to a 1.5% gain for the year, though, meaning it will be the euros EUR= fifth red year in six.

As usual the big swings have been in emerging markets. Argentinas peso ARS= and Turkeys lira TRY=, 2018s punchbags, have taken another beating. Argentinas woes have worsened such that it is restructuring its debt again while Turkeys worries have not really gone away.

At the other end of the spectrum, a new president and a new reform agenda have seen Ukraines hryvnia UAH= rocket 19%. Russias rouble is up 11% and Egypts pound EGP= is sandwiched in between with a 11.7% gain.

Everything added together it may well be the best first half of a year ever and one that not even the most wily investor would have predicted after the dire end to 2018 and what has happened since.

The world’s two top economies are slugging it out in a full-blown trade war and the recession warning klaxons are blaring, but still the performance numbers and milestones are astonishing.

The $8 trillion surge in global stocks is the result of a near 15% leap in MSCIs world index .MIWD00000PUS. That is challenging the dot.com boom days of 1997 as the best H1 in its near 40-year history.

Wall Street is up 18%, Europe 13% and China has jumped 20%, which is a lot of what it lost year even factoring in it has given back 5% since the trade tensions erupted again in early May.

Oil has raced almost 25% higher following its best first quarter since 2009. That has helped Russia’s rouble top the currency charts and though industrial metals have buckled badly in Q2, safe-haven gold is now scaling a six-year high.

“It has been really impressive,” said Swiss fund managers Pictet’s chief strategist Luca Paolini about the rebound from last year’s beating. “All sectors, all markets, all asset classes are in positive territory and that is rather unusual.”

A mirror image of 2018 when almost everything fell? Perhaps. But there have been two important drivers.

One was China showing it was serious about monetary and fiscal stimulus for its $14 trillion economy. The second of course has been the screeching change of direction by the Federal Reserve which suddenly looks set to cut U.S. interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis.

It has lit a fire under bond markets which have gone off like a rocket.

U.S. Treasuries, the world’s benchmark government IOUs, have made a whopping 7 percent as their yields have fallen almost 70 basis points this year. That followed a 37 basis point fall the last quarter of 2018, whereas in the five quarters prior to that they had consistently risen.

German Bunds - Europe’s go-to safe asset - have had their best H1 in two years, making roughly 5.5% as the European Central Bank has reversed course too. The yield on 10-year debt dropped below zero percent for the first time since 2016 in March and has since scored record lows.

MY BIG FAT GREEK RALLY

A statistic likely to make most jaws drop is that Greek banks -- remember all that euro debt crisis and capital controls stuff a few years back -- have been some of the world’s best performing stocks this year.

The countrys biggest lender Piraeus Bank BOPr.AT is up 250% and the smaller Attica Bank BOAr.AT is up 343%. Athens has also been Europes best bourse this year, though it all trails the 550% gain vegan darling Beyond Meat BTND.O has cooked up since its May stock market floatation.

Cryptoassets are back in vogue too with Bitcoin up 220% after its 2018 fall from grace and despite almost daily Brexit chaos and the loss of another prime minister, UK Gilts have returned 4.5%.

More risky high-yield debt, local-currency emerging market bonds and corporate debt have all brought in between 8%-9% and currency markets have been on the turn too.

“It is very unusual to see this breadth of strength,” said HSBC Asset Management’s chief global strategist, Joseph Little. “The question is, has it been too fast and too furious. It’s a very good question.”

The Feds pirouette means the dollar index .DXY is about to experience its first quarterly loss in over a year, with the yen up over 2.5% and the euro EUR= now back in the black having had its weakest Q1 since 2015.

The oil rally means the Canadian dollar -- up 4% -- and Norwegian crown -- up 1.5% -- have also done well, but as usual the wilder swings have been in emerging markets.

Argentinas peso ARS= and Turkeys lira TRY=, 2018s punchbags, have taken another beating though it was mainly earlier in the year when worries about both countries political and economic trajectories started to bite again.

At the other end of the spectrum, the Russian rouble, another big petrocurrency, is up 10.5%. Egypts pound EGP= and the Thai baht THB= are 7.2% and 5.2% higher, while Mexicos peso MXN= is now only 2% better off having been sapped by the recent run in with Donald Trump over migrants breaking the border.

FANGS VERY MUCH

Wall Streets rally has left the S&P 500 .SPX and Nasdaq .IXIC enjoying the view at record highs with the so-called FANG tech stocks providing much of the altitude again.

Facebook FB.O has surged 44%, Amazon AMZN.O 27 percent, and streaming giant Netflix NFLX.O has soared more than 38%.

Despite the fierce tensions with China over Huawei, the tech sector .SPLRCT still tops the S&P 500 too and Microsoft MSFT.O and Cisco are the top two performers on the Dow Jones .DJI having both leapt over 30%.

In contrast, Chinas tech sector .CSIINT is now up 28% year-to-date compared to 46% at the end of Q1 while online behemoth Alibaba BABA.K has handed back 5% of the 30% it had made.

“The next couple of weeks will set the tone for the second half. If trade talks momentum is gained, it would be hugely positive for risk assets,” Stefan Hofer, chief investment officer, LGT Bank Asia said.

“This is the most important (period) since the Global Financial Crisis. I can’t emphasize that enough.”');

Despite facing many unexpected challenges during the pandemic, Gaviria managed to increase Masiendas sales by expanding its e-commerce model.

Gaviria is a Capital One Spark Cash Plus customer and uses the card to pilot entrepreneurial initiatives for Masienda.

Masa — dough produced from stone-ground corn, transformed into tortillas and tostadas — is a multi-billion dollar industry. The problem is that most masa production relies on environmentally damaging agricultural systems that often strip the corn used of its flavor and health benefits.

When Jorge Gaviria learned of this while working in the restaurant industry, he set out on a quest in search of flavor and a holistic connection to corn in 2014. He ended up finding both in Oaxaca, Mexico, where he met farmers whose families had been growing maize for generations. From there he established a masa supply chain and launched his company Masienda, which is based in Los Angeles, CA. The business connects hundreds of independent heirloom farmers with restaurants, chefs, and consumers worldwide.

Oaxaca was a very natural place to end up, Gaviria said. The purity and expression of what I was looking for were fully present there, and the more I started to dig into what made that great flavor possible was what sold me. Plus, there was a way to create a positive impact in a community that really benefited from sourcing masa.

Ever since commercialized hybrid corn became popular in the US, heirloom farmers have found it challenging to compete. Masienda partners with them to help preserve their crops, culture, and wisdom. Because these farmers keep biodiversity at the forefront of their practices, there are more options for flavor. And the fact that they are subsistence farmers — meaning they grow food for their own consumption — ensures great attention to detail and long-term thinking in their work.

The farmers we work with have been practicing regenerative agriculture for thousands of years before it became a buzzword, Gaviria said. And its not just the farmers that were supporting directly through the purchase of corn, he said. Theres also a whole cottage industry emerging in the community.

Pandemic pivot

At the start of 2020, the Masienda team was excited about expanding and opening a new service for restaurants. But when the global pandemic hit, those plans came to a screeching halt. Throughout COVID-19, Gaviria has had to make some difficult decisions to stay in business, such as laying off half of his US-based team.

It felt like our whole identity, and our whole existence was over, Gaviria said. We were fixated on what wasnt in our control anymore, and we lost sight of what was in our control, which was an amazing opportunity for e-commerce and the Home Cook experience.

The Home Cook experience Gaviria is referring to is one of the new educational materials that Masienda created during the pandemic. This direct-to-consumer expansion, along with the creation of other new products geared towards preparing meals at home, has increased Masiendas e-commerce revenue by 30 to 40% and allowed him to continue to support heirloom farmers and their communities.

2021 Capital One

The power of partnership

Developing new products or services is an important, yet challenging task for many small businesses due to budget and cash flow constraints. Gaviria has overcome this challenge by maximizing his business card cash back rewards to help grow his business and launch new products, such as his tabletop masa mill. Since its inception, the tabletop mill has established an entirely new revenue stream for Masienda — which has inspired Gaviria and his team to explore additional products that they can develop with the help of their cash back rewards.

Gaviria also credits his Capital One Spark Cash Plus card, which lets business owners earn unlimited 2% cash back and has no preset spending limit, while giving them purchasing power that adapts to their business. This has allowed Gaviria to be strategic about pre-purchasing key supplies, especially with the pandemic introducing challenges from shipments to crossing borders.

If we didnt have a partnership with Capital One and we werent using the Spark Cash Plus card, everything weve been able to do for our business would have been a lot more difficult, Gaviria said. Thanks to using the card, we had a lot more flexibility in how we were able to alter our spending.

Additionally, using the card during the pandemic has shown Gaviria and his team the value of choosing the right partners. We see Capital One as more of a growth partner than a credit card company, he said. We were able to reinvest the cash back rewards into a whole new line of business thats growing exponentially.

Based on his experience with the Spark Cash Plus card, Gaviria hopes he can help other entrepreneurs realize they dont need to go to extreme lengths to expand their businesses.

I think a lot of entrepreneurs believe that the only way to expand is to sell a significant part of their company or take on a large amount of debt, he said. What weve figured out is that cards like the Spark Cash Plus card enable you to do more than just get your money back. We really treat our card like an innovation account. It helps us take calculated risks, and it makes the experience more fun.

And at the end of the day, the pursuit of fun, flavor and community, while preserving the culture and traditions of heirloom farmers in Oaxaca is what inspired Gaviria to create Masienda in the first place. Despite the ups and downs of the pandemic and having to let half of his US team go, hes been able to create ways for people to make masa from home and enjoy corn thats good for the planet and people.

Its fair to say that the restructuring of the team has made us stronger and more resilient than ever, Gaviria said, Were very tight as a unit and the momentum coming out of the height of COVID-19 has been very inspiring to everyone on board.

At bottlenecked West Coast shipping hubs that have played host to countless cargo ships, port officials note that dock workers and terminal operators have moved nearly 9 million containers, half a million more than they will have processed in all 12 months in the year 2020.

Shoppers are still having a hard time finding goods, and companies are still struggling to meet soaring COVID-19 era demand. But at a press conference on Thursday, Mario Cordero, executive director of the Port of Long Beach insisted there are “some signs of improvement” in addressing the holiday backlog.

“As of [Thursday] morning, there are 74 container ships on their way to the San Pedro Bay Port complex. Just off the coast, there are 28 container ships waiting at anchor. This is down from 86, just three weeks ago,” Cordero said.

Cordero said that congestion at the twin ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, which account for 40% of sea freight entering the United States, was a “temporary” situation, and part of the domino effect of the coronavirus.

Youll see some normalcy in the supply chain, in my opinion, summer of 2022, the port executive added.

Meaningful progress, delays everywhere

The number of container ships at anchor, or loitering within 40 miles of the ports, have improved due to the new queuing system which encourages ships to wait outside of a specially designated Safety and Air Quality Area (SAQA). That zone extends 150 miles to the west of the ports, and 50 miles to the north and South.

But other measures have found the bottlenecks still persist. According to data cited by trade outlet American Shipper, the actual tally of ships waiting outside L.A. and Long Beach hit an all-time high of 96 in early December, with 56 of those waiting outside the 40-mile zone.

Story continues

The congestion at Californias ports is “a bit of a mixed story, with bottlenecks still an issue amid some thawing.

“The situation on the ground is improving, but on the water its not yet improving,” Sanne Manders, COO of Flexport, told Yahoo Finance Live last week. “The front end of the traffic jam starts driving, where the back end is still backing up.”

Separately, figures from Marine Exchange of Southern California show there were 113 container ships waiting inside the 40-mile zone as of Wednesday. And Flexport’s Ocean Timeliness Indicator (OTI), which measures from the point of production to the destination port, showed travel times hit a record high of 112 days last week — caused by longer times taken for ocean vessels shipping from Asia to Europe.

Trans-Pacific Eastbound, China-to-US routes, jumped to 106 days, based on the time taken to ship cargo to the Asian ports, Flexport found.

Meanwhile, there have been massive delays at ports like Savannah, Georgia to Newark, New Jersey — and in Britain, the Netherlands, and China, with roughly six hundred cargo ships globally left waiting to unload at one point last month.

Amid the delays, California port officials have postponed a plan to slap fines on abandoned containers that have become an eyesore for residents.

The “Container Dwell Fee” has helped expedite containers from the terminals across the port complex, but Cordero said officials will monitor the situation and reassess implementation as early as Monday. Since the October announcement of the new fee, the ports have seen a cumulative 47% decline in the amount of aging cargo on their docks.

“We are also evacuating empty containers from our terminals. Empty containers account for about 36% of all containers on the terminals – this is down from 45%, just a couple weeks ago,” Cordero said on Thursday. “We are not out of the woods yet, but we are making meaningful progress.”

The fees came on the heels of the Biden Administration’s plan to establish around-the-clock operations at the L.A.-Long Beach hubs to ease pressure on the supply chain bottlenecks, but only one of seven container terminals at the port of LA has actually met the goal.

Retailers with clout make their own way

Meanwhile, individual major retail companies are taking measures into their own hands to bring products to the U.S. from overseas factories. Several retailers, including Walmart (WMT), The Home Depot (HD), and Target (TGT) and Ikea, have charted cargo ships to alleviate supply chain burdens on their own.

Big retailers might have “more clout” compared to “smaller” importers, Flexports Manders told Yahoo Finance.

“The reality is also theres not much that you can do. There isn’t like all of a sudden armies of truckers coming from anywhere else in the country to help these big retailers out,” he added.

Still, small businesses hope this season will provide a needed boost to business, with many battered by worker shortages, surging prices and a lack of needed goods.

Supply chain challenges will be with us for the foreseeable future across a number of sectors, Clara Shih, CEO of Salesforce Service Cloud, said in a statement.

These challenges have a massive impact on customer experience, which will only be more pronounced during the holiday season. Every company should be anticipating and proactively communicating with customers right now; otherwise, they will lose customer trust, Shih added.

In another effort to ease congestion, Long Beach announced Thursday a new data initiative to provide transparency for supply chain participants, which is targeting a February 2022 launch.

Called “Supply Chain Information Highway,” the project is mean to share data among participants so that cargo can be delivered more reliably and efficiently,” according to Noel Hacegaba, deputy executive director at the Port of Long Beach, told a press conference on Thursday.

The crisis has spurred more than half of manufacturers to make significant changes across their supply chains, according to Oden’s 2021 State of Manufacturing report. Industries like autos have started to re-shore or nearshore, scaling down production to be closer to customers, but even those efforts come with challenges.

“Asia has taken over all the [intellectual property] on how to manufacture goods, so its not that easy to all of a sudden say ‘like, oh yeah, lets do it then at home,’” Flexports Manders said.

(Reuters) -A U.S. appeals court on Friday reinstated a nationwide vaccine-or-testing COVID-19 mandate for large businesses, which covers 80 million American workers, prompting opponents to rush to the Supreme Court to ask it to intervene.

The ruling by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati lifted a November injunction that had blocked the rule from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which applies to businesses with at least 100 workers.

It is difficult to imagine what more OSHA could do or rely on to justify its finding that workers face a grave danger in the workplace, said the opinion. It is not appropriate to second-guess that agency determination considering the substantial evidence, including many peer-reviewed scientific studies, on which it relied.

President Joe Biden unveiled in September regulations to increase the adult vaccination rate as a way of fighting the pandemic, which has killed more than 750,000 Americans and weighed on the economy.

The ruling coincides with public health officials bracing for a tidal wave https://www.reuters.com/world/us/tidal-wave-omicron-could-put-us-covid-19-surge-into-overdrive-2021-12-17 of coronavirus infections in the United States as the more transmissible Omicron variant spreads rapidly worldwide.

While we are disappointed in the Court’s decision, we will continue to fight the illegal mandate in the Supreme Court, South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson said on Twitter. We are confident the mandate can be stopped.

Within hours of the ruling, at least three petitions were filed with the U.S. Supreme Court, asking it to immediately block the mandate.

A group of business groups representing retail, wholesale, warehousing, transportation, travel and logistics filed one of the first petitions with the high court, raising among other issues the potential for workers to quit rather than take the shot.

Story continues

The resulting labor upheaval will devastate already fragile supply chains and labor markets at the peak holiday season, said the petition.

Companies such as United Airlines have used mandates to increase the number of vaccinated employees, often with only a small number of workers refusing the shots.

But others such as Boeing Co have suspended their plans, in part because of court rulings putting government mandates on hold, but also due to resistance among workers.

Courts have blocked Bidens vaccine requirement for healthcare workers in half the states and a vaccine mandate for federal contractors has been blocked nationwide.

Fridays ruling was 2-1 with Judges Jane Stranch, appointed by President Barack Obama, and Julia Gibbons, appointed by President George W. Bush, in the majority. Judge Joan Larsen, appointed by President Donald Trump, dissented.

Republicans, conservative groups and trade organizations sued over the OSHA rule, arguing the agency overstepped its authority.

The rule set a Jan. 4 deadline for compliance, although it was unclear if that will be enforced because the rule was blocked for weeks.

This week, Bruce Springsteen sold both his master recordings and publishing rights to Sony Music in a deal worth north of $500 million, according to multiple outlets. Sony Music and Springsteen did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finances request for comment.

Sony has been Springsteens home for the past five decades. Thanks to this deal, the studio will now have full ownership of the rockers entire collection, including hits like Born to Run, Thunder Road, and Born in the U.S.A.

The historic deal underscores a new age within the music industry as streaming, led by Spotify (SPOT) and Apple (AAPL), continues to balloon the value of songs and records.

Guillermo Page, a former record label executive who worked for Sony and Universal, told Yahoo Finance that streaming has provided stability.

The key is that the business has become predictable, according to Page, who now teaches in the music program at the University of Miami.

Investors can trust in the future of the business because its growing. When you eliminate the uncertainty, it opens up a new door for investors to come in and snap those assets, he added.

Page said that Springsteens deal is particularly interesting, since it shows how record labels now want a piece of the action — as opposed to music investment funds like London-based Hipgnosis.

The record labels have decided to not let these type of deals fall through the cracks and lose valuable assets in their catalogs, he said.

The perfect storm

Springsteen is not the only big-name artist to strike publishing deals, as the dominance of streaming sparks a rush for artists — especially older ones — and labels to capitalize on a surge in revenue.

In May 2021, The Red Hot Chili Peppers sold the rights to its song catalog for a reported $150 million. Last year, Bob Dylan sold over 600 copyrights to Universal Music Group in a deal reportedly valued at over $300 million. Prior to that, Stevie Nicks sold a majority stake in her songwriting for a reported $100 million.

Story continues

Youre seeing all major acts from the 70s, 80s, and 90s that are riding the wave of streaming, Page said, explaining that artists can now capture a ton of money in ways they were not able to do in the past.

Its the perfect storm for artists who can now maximize their return on the sale of those assets, he continued.

In the case of Springsteen, the rocker sold both his masters (the recordings of the actual songs), along with his songwriting (also known as the publishing side of the business).

Bruce Springsteen performs onstage during the 15th Annual Stand Up For Heroes benefit at Alice Tully Hall presented by Bob Woodruff Foundation and NY Comedy Festival on November 08, 2021 in New York City.

Its like two deals in one because [Sony] is acquiring both sides of a song, Page explained.

For context, music publishing encompasses the copyrights for songwriting and composition, such as lyrics and melodies. Although publishing rights are often not worth as much as actual recordings, they can still lead to a significant amount of revenue over time with radio play, advertising, movie licensing and more.

It gets to the point where theres money coming from so many different places that you cant go wrong on any type of deals like this, Page noted.

Overall, the former record label exec. said he expects more catalog deals in the future as the investors are out there.

In addition, he surmised that more up-and-coming artists are going to want to own their masters, a direct result of their predecessors success.

Theres going to be a whole new generation of musicians who are going to pay more attention to the deals theyre signing with a record label, he said.

Just like Springsteen, they may want to own their destiny, Page added.

Editors note: Attention to coarse language in paragraph 12 that could offend readers)

By Jan Wolfe and Trevor Hunnicutt

WASHINGTON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat who is key to President Joe Bidens hopes of passing a $1.75 trillion domestic investment bill, said on Sunday he would not support the package, drawing a sharp rebuke from the White House.

Manchin appeared to deal a fatal blow to Bidens signature domestic policy bill, which is known as Build Back Better and aims to expand the social safety net and tackle climate change.

I cannot vote to continue with this piece of legislation, Manchin said during an interview with the Fox News Sunday program, citing concerns about inflation https://www.reuters.com/world/us/runaway-consumer-prices-complicate-democrats-agenda-midterm-hopes-2021-12-13. I just cant. I have tried everything humanly possible.

He then released a statement accusing his party of pushing for an increase in the debt load that would drastically hinder the United States ability to respond to the coronavirus pandemic and geopolitical threats.

My Democratic colleagues in Washington are determined to dramatically reshape our society in a way that leaves our country even more vulnerable to the threats we face, Manchin said in a statement.

The White House responded angrily, accusing him of breaking his promise to find common ground and get the bill passed.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Manchins comments represent a sudden and inexplicable reversal in his position. Bidens administration would find a way to move forward with the legislation in 2022, she said.

Many Democrats feel passage of the bill is essential to the partys chances of maintaining control of Congress in next years elections.

Story continues

The White House had hoped to keep negotiations cordial and private to avoid alienating Manchin, who represents West Virginia, a state that Biden lost to former President Donald Trump by almost 40 percentage points in the 2020 election.

But many top Biden allies believe Manchin is damaging the Democratic presidents political future, and Psakis public rebuke of the senator suggested a new phase in Bidens push for legislation he regards as essential to his legacy.

Manchins comments also drew outrage from liberal Democrats.

Lets be clear: Manchin’s excuse is bullshit, U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said on Twitter.

Senator Bernie Sanders, who helped shape the bill, called for a vote to be held on the package of measures anyway.

The bill would raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations to pay for a host of programs to thwart climate change, boost healthcare subsidies and provide free childcare.

Biden has argued that lowering such costs is critical at a time of rising inflation and as the economy recovers from the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. Republicans say the proposed legislation would increase the federal deficit https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-argue-bidens-175-trillion-social-plan-would-add-deficit-2021-12-10, fuel inflation and hurt the economy.

UPHILL STRUGGLE

Manchins support is crucial in a chamber where the Democrats have the slimmest margin of control and Republicans are united in their opposition to the bill.

Even if Manchin were somehow convinced to back the bill, the White House would still have to win over Senator Kyrsten Sinema, another moderate Democrat who has not committed to supporting it.

Though talks with Manchin had been going poorly, Bidens aides had expressed confidence in recent days that they would eventually secure a deal.

Sanders, a democratic socialist who is aligned with Democrats in the Senate, told CNN on Sunday that he thinks there should still be a vote on the proposed legislation, despite Manchins opposition.

If he doesnt have the courage to do the right thing for the working families of West Virginia and America, let him vote no in front of the whole world, Sanders told CNN.

Biden last month signed into law a $1 trillion infrastructure bill designed to create jobs by dispersing money to state and local governments to fix crumbling bridges and roads and by expanding broadband internet access.

Liberal Democrats in Congress had pushed for the coupling of the Build Back Better legislation with the infrastructure bill in the hope of ensuring the passage of the former.

U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, led an effort in September to decouple the two bills.

This is exactly what we warned would happen if we separated Build Back Better from infrastructure, Omar said on Twitter. (Reporting by Jan Wolfe and Trevor Hunnicutt; Additional reporting by David Brunnstrom Editing by Kieran Murray, Doina Chiacu, Daniel Wallis and Paul Simao)');

JPMorgan Chase has agreed to pay a $125 million fine after allowing employees to discuss bank business on personal phones.

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced Friday that it found widespread and longstanding failures to preserve written communications among JPMorgan employees, who were using WhatsApp, email, and text to discuss securities business matters, a violation of federal law.

The regulator found that the practice took place between at least January 2018 and November 2020 and was prevalent throughout the firm.

Indeed, supervisors, including managing directors and other senior supervisors ... used their personal devices to communicate about the firms securities business, the commission said in a statement regarding the charges.

Financial institutions are required by law to keep records of business communications between brokers and clients. The SEC discovered JPMorgan was violating that rule when one of the firms brokers wasnt able to produce records during the investigation, Reuters Katanga Johnson reported.

JPMorgan has admitted to the charges and, along with the fine, has agreed to hire a compliance consultant to review the firms record-keeping policies, the SEC said.

A spokesperson for JPMorgan did not immediately respond to Insiders request for comment.

JPMorgan Securities, the broker-deal subsidiary of JPMorgan, agreed to pay $200 million in fines on Friday from two US regulators over issues related to employees widespread use of unapproved communication methods like WhatsApp.

The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission fined JPMorgan $125 million and $75 million, respectively.

A spokesperson for JPMorgan declined to comment on the fines.

According to an SEC press release announcing the fines, JPMorgan Securities admitted that from January 2018 through November 2020 its employees discussed business matters on their personal devices via text messages, WhatsApp, and email.

The CFTC noted in its press release announcing the penalty that JPMorgan employees including those at senior levels communicated via text messages and WhatsApp dating back to at least July 2015.

Financial firms are required by regulators to keep a record of employee conversations related to business dealings. However, conversations that take place outside of approved channels make it difficult for firms compliance teams to do so.

And while messengers like WhatsApp have long be a thorn in Wall Streets side, the pandemic exacerbated the problem.

In November 2020, Insider spoke with more than a dozen traders, compliance experts, tech providers and other market participants to learn more about the surge in WhatsApp use, how Wall Street firms are trying to stop it, and why traders keep getting caught in the fallout.

On Friday, the SEC acknowledged that the use of unapproved messengers was an industry problem that the agency would look deeper into.

The news: Most US consumers have adopted tools that depend on open banking as part of their day-to-day banking experience, according to a recent survey from Mastercard:

81% of US adults are currently linking their bank accounts to third-party financial apps. The adoption is even higher among young and more diverse communities.

69% of US adults say they think about connected accounts sometimes or often.

Brazil-based credit startup Open Co, Indias BNPL card fintech Uni, and US cannabis card provider SuperNet are all addressing unmet payment needs.

Insider Intelligence publishes hundreds of insights, charts, and forecasts on the Payments & Commerce industry. Learn more about becoming a client.

The news: Three fintech startups raised fresh capital to expand their consumer credit offerings in markets with needs that havent been met by legacy payment providers.

Insider Intelligence

Brazil-based credit startup Open Co raised $115 million in a funding round led by SoftBank Latin America Fund, per TechCrunch.

The startup was created from a merger between online lender Geru and Rebel, which used alternative underwriting data sources to extend credit. Open Co claims its faster and offers lower interest rates than traditional banks—which lets it tap into a broader swath of Brazils credit-hungry market.

Its is trying to solve Brazils credit problem: An estimated 52% of consumers need to use credit for basic expenses, per TechCrunch—but they face sky-high interest rates. In 2019, credit card interest rates hit a whopping 299.8%, per Brazils central bank. The average interest rate for credit card accounts in the US that year was 14.87%, per ValuePenguin.

Open Co plans to put the funding toward product development, expansion, and hiring.

India-based payments fintech Uni snagged $70 million in Series A funding, per Mint.

Like local fintech competitor Slice , Uni uses proprietary underwriting technology to extend credit to consumers who struggle to get approved by large banks that use traditional systems of determining creditworthiness.

Unis Pay ⅓ card automatically splits purchases into three installments spread over three months. If customers pay on time, they arent charged interest, and if they pay everything within the first month, they get 1% cash back.

In India, theres a large gap between credit and debit cardholders: As of September, India had about 65 million credit cardholders versus 920 million debit cardholders, according to data from the countrys central bank.

Unis underwriting technology, coupled with growing appetite for buy now, pay later services in Asia-Pacific, could set it up for long-term growth.

Uni plans to put the funding toward product development.

Issuer-processor startup SuperNet raised an undisclosed amount in Series A funding, per a press release.

The US-based startup is using the funding to develop a credit card tailored to the cannabis industry.

Despite being a multibillion-dollar industry, the majority of consumer cannabis transactions (legal or not) are cash-based, per TechCrunch—and cannabis dispensaries often have to allocate a lot of time and money to manage this cash. Because cannabis is still illegal at the federal level its difficult for banks to offer payment services to businesses in the industry—which is where SuperNet steps in.

The startup will offer customers a card that can be used to pay for products at 100 California dispensaries starting in January. SuperNet will also process transactions for the dispensaries and offer a loyalty program.

Insider Intelligence

The threat to card players: Letting users pay directly from their bank accounts minimizes their reliance on cards, which could lead to less volume—and revenues—for networks and issuers.

Klarnas A2A integration reflects a broader battle for consumer spending between credit card issuers and BNPL providers. BNPL players are attracting customers with their interest-free installment solutions: 36.9% of US consumers who used BNPL said they wanted to avoid credit card interest, according to The Motley Fool. In response to the BNPL threat, many issuers (like US Bank) have come up with their own flexible payment options.

Klarnas opportunity: The A2A solution benefits Klarna in three key ways:

Gives users more ways to pay for their purchases. The A2A payment offering gives users more control, and its potentially easier to use. For instance, some customers may prefer to pay their BNPL balance through bank transfers to avoid filling out lengthy card payment details.

Cuts costs with lower card fees. The A2A integration can help Klarna save on interchange fees—which cost US merchants $44.4 billion last year, per the Nilson Report—helping increase its bottom line. Klarna could also decide to pass these savings onto its merchant partners in the form of lower retailer fees: For many of its products, Klarna makes money by charging partner merchants to enable its BNPL solution. This can help solidify Klarnas merchant relationships, especially as BNPL competition heats up.

Protection from potential issuer retaliation. With credit cards facing tighter competition from BNPL providers, some issuers may decide to bar or limit BNPL transactions from their cards like Capital One did last year. Enabling A2A payments lets Klarna provide a workaround for customers in the event of more BNPL card bans.

Financial advisors are not regulated, though ones who provide investing advice and services must register with their state or federal regulatory bodies.

Financial advisors offer a wide variety of services, such as portfolio building, tax and estate planning, budgets, and more.

Visit Insiders Investing Reference library for more stories.

Do you plan to retire one day? Maybe get married or go to college? How about paying down some debt? These are all reasonable and attainable financial goals. For many of us, however, its not always clear what we have to do to make these dreams come true. And thats when it might be a good idea to enlist some professional help.

A financial advisor can be a valuable asset if you have financial goals you want to reach, but arent sure how to make that happen. They can also educate you about financial products, tax advantages and insurance options you may not have known could help you build and protect wealth. Heres a closer look at what a financial advisor is and what they can offer you.

What is a financial advisor?

A financial advisor is a professional who provides their clients with guidance pertaining to financial goals, mortgages, insurance, retirement, investing, and general financial management. The term is often used interchangeably with financial planner and can cover a very broad scope of expertise. While some financial advisors offer a variety of services, many specialize only in making and managing investments.

I became a financial advisor to mentor my clients through all financial aspects of their lives, says John Stoj, investment advisor representative and founder of Verbatim Financial. This can include investments, but also questions surrounding careers, business ownership, estate planning, insurance, and taxes ... essentially anything that can benefit from planning.

Types of financial advisors

These days, youll find a variety of types of financial advisors available to you. Some of the most common include:

Robo-advisor: A robo-advisor is an automated platform that makes investment recommendations based on information you input to the system. It uses algorithms and often artificial intelligence to determine your risk tolerance and what investments may be good to make. These kinds of services are generally low-cost, but limited in what they can offer.

It uses algorithms and often artificial intelligence to determine your risk tolerance and what investments may be good to make. These kinds of services are generally low-cost, but limited in what they can offer. Online financial-planning services: These services go a step further than robo-advisors, often offering a broader scope of options. Online financial-planning services are usually automated and can help you build financial plans and budgets, in addition to portfolio building, goal setting, and reporting.

These services go a step further than robo-advisors, often offering a broader scope of options. Online financial-planning services are usually automated and can help you build financial plans and budgets, in addition to portfolio building, goal setting, and reporting. Traditional financial advisors: These include Certified Financial Planners (CFP), brokers, Registered Investment Advisors (RIA), and wealth managers. Traditional financial advisors usually provide comprehensive, personalized advice regarding your financial life. They can provide product recommendations based on your specific situation and goals, make investments on your behalf, and help ensure you stay on track.

What does a financial advisor do?

Financial advisors can offer a wide array of services. Some focus only on investments and portfolio building/management. Others provide comprehensive services for everything from saving for college and retirement to tax strategies and budgeting.

In an ideal world, a financial advisor should look at your overall financial picture and help you build a plan to get to and through retirement, says Mary Lyons, financial advisor and founder of Benchmark Income Group. That includes investment portfolio management, but it also includes reviewing your insurance coverage, working with your estate attorney, communicating with your CPA, helping you determine the structure of your mortgage, and budgeting. A good financial advisor should be able to answer any questions you have about your finances.

There are no specific licenses or certifications that make one a financial advisor. They will usually have some kind of background related to finance, such as a degree in business, economics, or accounting. To trade or advise on investments, financial advisors are required to take and pass the NASAA Investment Advisers Law Examination — also known as the Series 65 exam — and register with state and/or federal regulators. If they want to sell insurance and other financial products, they may have to hold additional licenses to comply with regulations.

If youre in the market for a financial advisor, its a good idea to shop around to find someone who offers services that are the right fit for your situation. Also take note of how they make money. Working with a fiduciary, such as a CFP or RIA, is often preferred. These financial advisors usually have a fee-only business model, which means they charge clients directly for their services and dont receive any kind of commission.

Quick tip: According to the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors, a fiduciary is a professional entrusted to manage assets or wealth while putting the clients best interests first at all times. RIAs are legally bound to act as fiduciaries. All CFPs are obligated to be fiduciaries by their boards Code of Ethics.

On the other hand, financial advisors may work on a commission basis. John Hagensen, founder and managing director of Keystone Wealth Partners, explains that many financial professionals who will claim to be financial advisors are contracted by insurance companies and/or broker-dealers and thus be compensated to sell products of those companies. This type of compensation can influence the kinds of products such advisors recommend and actions they suggest taking.

Just about anyone can benefit from working with a financial advisor. Some of the more common services they offer include the following:

1. Portfolio building

Portfolio building is all about ensuring you have a balance of investment assets that are growing efficiently with minimal risk. Financial advisors can help you understand what you already own in assets, what your options may be for making further investments, and what kinds of risks you may face with your investment choices.

A financial advisor should help you determine how much fluctuation you can tolerate in your daily balances as well as during outlying events like 2008 or even the first part of 2020, Lyons explains. They should address concepts like maximum drawdown and the amount of return you can expect for the risk you are taking.

2. Tax planning

Many financial advisors provide tax-planning services. This doesnt mean theyll help you file your tax returns or are fully trained in tax law like a certified public accountant (CPA) is. Instead, they can help you manage tax liability that results from your investment strategies and help you build wealth by taking advantage of rules that can lower your tax liability.

Not every financial advisor offers or is qualified to offer these kinds of services, but some are also CPAs. At the very least, a financial advisor should be willing to work with your accountant or tax attorney to ensure your financial plan is keeping your tax liability at a minimum and not creating new issues.

3. Estate planning

A financial advisor can help you plan for what you want to pass on to your heirs when you die. They may be trained in estate planning or be willing to work with you estate attorney to determine what kind of insurance you need, what kinds of financial products you might want to set up to pass on (such as a trust or giving fund), what should be done with your investments, etc.

Its critical that all of your team – CPA, attorney, banker, advisor — is communicating at least annually, Lyons says. If not, they could be working against each other instead of all pulling in the right direction.

4. Long and short-term financial planning

Financial advisors work with clients to create and execute plans designed to achieve goals both in the short term and over a long period of time. For example, you might work with a financial advisor to review your debt and create a plan to reduce the amount you owe this year.

At the same time, you may also want to create a college savings account for your new baby. A financial advisor could work with you to create a month-to-month budget that targets reducing your debt while funneling deposits to a 529 college savings plan.

Quick tip: Investing in a life or disability insurance policy can be a good strategy for reaching long-term financial goals. Many financial advisors are licensed to sell insurance. Be sure to ask if your advisor offers this service and how insurance might enhance your long-term financial plan.

7 questions to a financial advisor before you hire them

Below are a few of the most important questions to ask a financial adviser youre considering hiring.

1. Are you a fiduciary?

First and foremost, you want to ensure your financial planner or investment adviser is a fiduciary. A fiduciary is legally bound to put their clients interests first.

If theyre not a registered fiduciary, they may follow a loosely monitored suitability standard, which allows them to make recommendations for investments and services so long as its suitable for their clients goals, risk tolerance, and financial situation. Usually this translates to recommendations that will also earn them money.

2. How much do you charge?

There are two types of financial advisers: fee-based and fee-only.

To visit with a fee-only financial adviser, you will pay a flat fee, hourly fee, or if theyre handling your investments, an asset under management fee equal to between 1% and 3% of your total assets.

If youre meeting once or twice to create a financial plan or get advice, you can expect to pay anywhere between $100 and $300 an hour. If youre looking for access to an adviser on a rolling basis (i.e. you want help implementing and maintaining your financial plan) you may pay a fixed fee, usually between $1,000 and $3,000.

3. Do you earn commission?

If they answer yes, theyre considered a fee-based financial adviser. Fee-based financial advisers earn commissions based on where you put your money, and also may charge a fee for their time or an asset under management fee.

By contrast, fee-only advisers do not receive additional commission when a client invests in a certain fund or financial product. Their only objective is to provide sound financial advice.

This doesnt mean a fee-based financial adviser will necessarily work against your best interests. It only means that they may be more inclined to recommend products and services for which they get a commission, which may or may not be the best option for your financial planning needs.

4. What services are included?

A good financial planner should be able to offer guidance on every aspect of your financial situation, though they may specialize in a certain area, like retirement planning or wealth management. Make sure its clear from the get-go what the cost includes and whether theyll spend more time focusing on any one area.

An investment adviser is usually focused only on managing investments, but they may also provide guidance on other aspects of your financials. Again, make sure you know what exactly is included in their menu of services.

5. How often will we communicate?

If you want more than a one-time meeting, youll probably pay your financial adviser a retainer fee. Find out exactly what this fee gets you — for example, maybe its one face-to-face meeting and one phone call a month — and ask if there are any additional fees that apply for overtime.

It can be scary putting your money in someone elses hands, so an open line of communication is essential. Ask the financial adviser how theyre best reached — by text, email, or phone — for both urgent and non-urgent matters.

6. Can you describe your typical client?

Asking an adviser about their typical client can help you decide whether theyre a good fit for you. Some financial planners specialize in helping high-net-worth families or business owners or first-time investors in their 20s and 30s.

If you identify with their typical client, chances are they have the tools and expertise to help you, too.

7. What is your investment approach?

If youre handing over control of your investments, make sure the advisers approach to investing is aligned with your risk tolerance. For example, an adviser may prefer aggressive growth strategies to preservation. That usually means theyll risk more of your money in order to (hopefully) score a bigger return.

Ultimately, a good financial adviser should be as mindful with your investments as they are with their own, taking care to avoid excessive fees, save money on taxes, and be as transparent as possible about your gains and losses.

If youre hiring a fee-based adviser, know that their strategy for your investments may include products or services for which they receive a kickback. If this is the case, ask to read over any disclosures.

The financial takeaway

Consulting with a financial advisor is a smart way to make headway in achieving both short-term and long-term financial goals. You should always research what options are available to you and ask questions about what services are offered and how they are compensated.

Since there is no education or experience requirement for someone to be a financial advisor, its also a good idea to look into the background of anyone youre considering working with regarding your money.

Some advisors will focus only on a handful of services, while others offer more comprehensive planning and management options. New technology has also given way to automated financial tools. Its up to you to investigate and determine whats the right fit for your situation.');

His investor base shifted from 80% owned by Wall Street to more than 80% owned by retail investors.

A canny social-media presence helped woo the new backers, whove stuck around longer than expected.

In 2021, AMC Entertainments investor base underwent a dramatic shift. Like many publicly traded companies, the theater chain historically has been owned at least 80% by institutional investors — large money managers, pensions, and endowments.

But after becoming a meme-stock favorite among retail traders, who have rabidly bought up its shares and sent its stock price through the roof this year, the dynamic flipped: AMC is now more than 80% owned by individual investors, some 4.1 million in all by the companys latest official count.

Were one of the few companies on the New York Stock Exchange where individual retail investors are clearly in control of the company. They own the company, CEO Adam Aron told Insider in a recent interview.

That means AMC has been navigating through uncharted waters, as Aron put it, requiring a novel approach to investor communications.

Aron has a long history of catering to consumers

Communicating with retail investors is a task Aron is uniquely suited for — his sprawling, 40-year corporate résumé is littered with catchy marketing and loyalty programs that resonated with retail customers at airlines, hotels, cruise lines, and ski resorts.

He helped created the WorldPass, a pioneering frequent-flyer program at Pan American airlines in the 1980s. A few years later, he launched one of the earliest hotel loyalty programs for Hyatt. At Vail Resorts, business surged under his decade of leadership that ended in 2006, thanks in part to the unveiling of a popular subscription plan for skiing.

Back in April, when the companys meme-stock status was still fresh, Aron and his team made a conscious decision to lean in to social media and embrace these new investors, Aron said. That required an active Twitter presence that transcended the traditional corporate speak.

Hes embraced the new role with gusto, amassing a colossal social-media following by directly engaging with the self-styled Reddit Apes and speaking their language, which Aron says humanizes the connection between the investor and company they own. He recently attracted the attention of Elon Musk, Mark Cuban, and millions more on Twitter by polling followers about accepting cryptocurrencies like dogecoin and shiba inu as payment.

I write all these tweets myself. That doesnt mean I dont send them around to be looked at or edited by others. But this is not being done by a PR staff or social-media staff, Aron told Insider.

AMC also rolled out AMC Investor Connect, a program to communicate directly with shareholders and offer them perks, like free popcorn and exclusive screenings. More than 425,000 people have signed up so far, Aron said.

The company been rewarded with a highly engaged group of shareholders who have held on to the stock — and kept its share price uplifted — far longer than Wall Streets establishment expected.

There is a tremendous amount of inbound commentary to the company from our shareholder base, which is illuminating, because it really helps us to understand what the owners of our company are thinking, Aron said.

Aron uses social media as a sounding board for new ideas

Aron doesnt just read messages from investors, he takes highly visible public action to demonstrate hes taking them seriously — often gathering valuable intelligence in the process.

For instance, Aron was inundated with direct messages suggesting that AMC accept the cryptocurrency dogecoin. But he wondered just how popular this idea was in actuality.

So he market tested the concept with a Twitter poll, at essentially no cost, and had a resounding answer within 24 hours. The poll garnered 140,000 votes — 77% in favor — and more than 4 million views, Aron reported, and AMC is in the process of adding dogecoin to the list of cryptocurrencies it accepts as payment.

AMC quarterly earnings calls, which used to cater to Wall Street research analysts, now revolve around retail investors and their ideas for the company, which involve questions about crypto, NFTs, AMC merch, eSports, and more.

One of his most impressive achievements in investor relations, and a testament to the currency hes earned with this new investor base, has been his navigation of the thorny issue of AMC executives, himself included, cashing in large portions of their shares.

Among the meme-stock crowd, holding or increasing your shares is a virtue — commonly referred to as Diamond Hands — while selling your stake is a grievous faux pas and something mockingly referred to as having Paper Hands.

Some analysts expected executives off-loading their shares would infuriate the Main Street investors, causing the stock to fall.

Aron elected to get ahead of the issue this summer with transparency, repeatedly alerting investors that he would sell a portion of his holdings over the coming months for estate-planning purposes while vowing to remain heavily invested in the firm.

AMC execs sold $55 million worth of shares in November — $25 million by Aron — according SEC filings reviewed by Insider via Sentieo. More will be sold in the coming months as part of a prearranged plan handled by his bank, Aron has said.

I can only imagine that naysayers and others who wish AMC harm will try to spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt in this regard, Aron said on the companys November earnings call.

AMCs stock remained stable through it all.

They came out unscathed, said Alicia Reese, a Wedbush analyst who covers AMC.

Indeed, the Silverback, as Aron is admiringly called by many retail traders, is as popular as ever. At a special screening he hosted in early December for the new movie Being the Ricardos, stars Javier Bardem and Nicole Kidman made surprise appearances, but Adam Aron was a star himself, shaking hands, signing autographs, and taking selfies with the audience.

Square Inc., now called Block, is expanding its narrative to include businesses of all sizes.

Its CFO, Amrita Ahuja, told Insider about how cryptocurrency is influencing its financial growth.

This article is part of the CFO Project: Future of Finance series that drills down on whats on the agendas of some of todays most influential financial executives.

Get a daily selection of our top stories based on your reading preferences. Loading Something is loading. Email address By clicking ‘Sign up’, you agree to receive marketing emails from Insider as well as other partner offers and accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy

Square Inc., which recently changed its name to Block, equips people with tools to help run and grow their businesses including commerce solutions, business software, and banking capabilities.

Block is a global technology company focused on financial services that includes the digital payments company called Square. The firm, led by Jack Dorsey, who recently stepped down as Twitters CEO, reported a gross profit of $1.13 billion in the third quarter, while its Cash App offering generated $512 million.

Though revenue growth slowed from past quarters, the company nearly doubled its payments in Q3 — $15.5 billion — for businesses with more than $500,000 in annual sales. Previously, small businesses with annual payment sales of less than $125,000 outperformed these larger sellers.

This is positive news for Block Chief Financial Officer Amrita Ahuja. Square has been appealing for smaller businesses, but Ahuja told Insider shed worked to expand its narrative: It wants to support small and large businesses alike with not only payments but software and integrated solutions, hardware, and financial services. Ahuja said that explaining its rapidly growing Cash App to people was also key to its messaging.

Previously, Ahuja was the chief financial officer of Blizzard Entertainment, where she focused on the intersection of digital media and video-game publishing. Ahuja told The Wall Street Journal this year that she became excited about Square because of its impact on small-business owners like her parents, who had immigrated from India and owned a day-care center in a Cleveland suburb.

Blocks earnings report said it ended the third quarter with $7.4 billion in available liquidity , with $6.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments in marketable debt securities, as well as $500 million available to be withdrawn from our revolving credit facility.

Ahuja said this financial statement put Block in a position for long-term success.

We believe we have a strong balance sheet that affords us the flexibility to invest for the long-term both organically and opportunistically inorganically, and we expect our balance sheet to grow over time, she said.

Ahuja said Blocks investments tended to be long-term ones. While its willing to adapt, the company has a strong belief that investing over long periods will show the strongest returns, she said.

As we measure effectiveness of those investments, we think about compelling unit economics and about efficiency in returns on those investments across product development, sales and marketing, and customer operations, she said.

Ahuja said she believes artificial intelligence/machine learning and cryptocurrency and blockchain technology will disrupt commerce and other fields in the future.

Ahuja said AI and machine learning would help companies like Block launch products in industries that were otherwise restricted because of a lack of technology or inadequate risk models. These new capabilities, she said, could open the funnel and provide more people access to automation tools.

AI/ML will enable companies and their employees to be more efficient — the potential to quadruple revenues while only doubling employees, she said.

And Ahuja said she believes that while crypto will perhaps initially be used as an asset like gold, it will act more as a currency in the future. The verifiability, transparency and independence of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency will be disruptive, she said.

Ahuja said that she wanted Block to build skills in both of these areas and have a strong understanding of their capabilities.

One way Block is staying ahead of the curve is through investments in its newest business unit, called TBD, which is focused on building a decentralized, open platform to exchange bitcoin. This is in addition to the development of Block hardware wallet, a product that Block says will normalize bitcoin storage. Its also said to be considering developing a bitcoin mining system to help make mining more accessible.

According to Bitcoin Treasuries, Block held about 8,000 bitcoins valued at about $376 million as of Tuesday.

To further solidify its place in the cryptocurrency industry, Block has committed $10 million through its Bitcoin Clean Energy Investment Initiative to support a more sustainable bitcoin ecosystem, Ahuja said.

The Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index has estimated that the cryptocurrency uses more energy than nations like Sweden, Insider reported earlier this year. A Bloomberg report in July estimated that bitcoin-mining machines worldwide used the same amount of power as Bangladesh.

We hope this initiative accelerates the transition of the entire blockchain to clean power rather than only removing the carbon for the bitcoin that [Block] processes, Ahuja said.

Clarification: Square Inc. is now known as Block. Weve updated the article to reflect that change.');

In the US housing boom, small and midsize lenders trying to preserve slim profits are an opportunity for AI and machine learning solutions.

Insider Intelligence publishes hundreds of insights, charts, and forecasts on the Fintech industry. Learn more about becoming a client.

The news: Maxwell Financial Labs and its subsidiary Maxwell Lender Solutions—a US-based fintech mortgage solutions platform founded in 2015—launched what it claims is a first of its kind product platform, Maxwell Processor Edge, targeting small to midsized lenders.

eMarketer

What does it do? The web-based application is custom-designed for loan processors and integrates with lenders loan origination systems. It uses machine learning and AI to accelerate the document review process and detect data discrepancies before underwriting.

US loan closing timelines have averaged about 52 days, according to the Ellie Mae Origination Insight Report. Maxwell claims its solutions help loan officers close 15% more loans each month while shortening the process by more than 13 days.

Maxwell CEO John Paasonen said Maxwells revenues have grown 250% over the past year. The company says it serves more than 300 lenders nationwide and has facilitated more than $150 billion in loan volume to date.

In the last year and a half, Maxwell has raised $73.8 million from its backers, including Wells Fargo Strategic Capital, per Bloomberg, which pegged the companys valuation in October at $450 million.

Whats the opportunity? The US saw the most home sales since 2006 last year. Faced with record demand for mortgage services—as well as social distancing requirements that made in-person meetings more difficult—traditional lenders shifted from manual, paper-based processes to automated digital solutions. As loan expenses neared a record high in 2021, lenders sought greater processing efficiency and speed.

Smaller community lenders represent 60.7% of the $4 trillion US mortgage industry—but theyre competing with incumbent banks, neobanks , and megalenders like Quicken Loans and loanDepot.

Net income per loan has decreased nearly 63% since its high in Q3 2020, while the cost per loan has ballooned by more than 15%.

Greater market compression and rising loan costs mean profit margins will be even harder to maintain in 2022 as interest rates increase and mortgage volumes shift toward purchases.

The bigger picture: To prevail in the crowded residential lending solutions market, Maxwell will need strong partnerships and additional funding to spur innovation.

Its biggest competitor, Blend, says it processes on average more than $5 billion in loans daily. Blend reached a $3.3 billion valuation in April.

Other competing solutions and services include the Google Cloud-backed Lending DocAI, Black Knights Underwriter Assist, Roostify, and Ocrolus (which recently partnered with Blend).

Two of the biggest US lenders, UWM and Rocket Mortgage, have made their in-house mortgage origination technology available to partners.

Tools like OnboardConnects credit risk assessment and fraud detection solutions can free up much-needed resources.

Insider Intelligence publishes hundreds of insights, charts, and forecasts on the Payments & Commerce industry. Learn more about becoming a client.

The news: Credit reporting agency Equifax launched OnboardConnect, an API solution that lets organizations onboard new businesses faster for B2B transactions, per a press release. The offering uses Equifaxs data sources and analytics to help organizations verify businesses, check for fraud, confirm tax identification information, and conduct anti-money laundering and credit risk assessments.

Insider Intelligence

Why its worth watching: Theres a lot of untapped potential in the B2B payments market that providers like Equifax are hoping to capitalize on.

Next year, US B2B transactions are projected to hit $28.611 trillion, according to Insider Intelligence forecasts. Despite the vast market value, B2B payments are riddled with pain points—like slow payments, high security risks, and the manual onboarding and compliance assessment processes many businesses still rely on. Approximately 52.5% of firms said theyve spent time screening businesses to ensure theyre operating legally during the B2B onboarding process, and many still do manual tasks like passing physical documents between stakeholders, per a 2020 PYMNTS report.

The opportunity: OnboardConnect can help organizations digitize business onboarding, and tools like its credit risk assessment and fraud detection solutions can free up much-needed resources.

The offering can help organizations save time, effort, and money when bringing on new business customers.

Tasks like processing physical documents and confirming legal standing can be time-consuming and arduous for organizations. These manual processes can also be expensive, which can hurt cash flows.

Equifaxs solution digitizes and simplifies these tasks—letting organizations redistribute resources in a way that best contributes to their bottom lines.

It can also help organizations more easily find new clients that they might previously have overlooked, like small businesses—which can be harder to verify than larger and more established businesses.

Manual onboarding and business verification processes are prone to human error, which can be costly for organizations, especially if the error results in security and compliance issues: Last year, almost one-quarter of all data breaches globally were caused by humans, costing businesses an average of $3.33 million, per IBM.

Because OnboardConnect uses Equifaxs vast analytics and data tools, businesses dont have to do things like compliance checks manually and therefore are less likely to run into problems later in the transaction process.

This ensures that organizations are reaching only the healthiest business prospects and can also help them gain their customers trust.

And it can help organizations avoid costly errors during the onboarding process.

Do you work in the Banking industry? Get business insights on the latest tech innovations, market trends, and your competitors with data-driven research.

Small and midsize financial institutions (FIs)—those with under $100 billion in assets—cant hope to compete directly with the quality of digital user experience (UX) on offer at the largest US banks due to their smaller tech budgets. Per 2020 eMarketer data, the nine largest US banks accounted for 60% of total banking IT/tech expenses as of May 2020.

Improving the customer experience is the top objective for community-based banks and credit unions. Insider Intelligence

And with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic ultimately forcing banks of all sizes to reduce in-person services and turn to digital, FIs face intense pressure to keep up with digitization demands. Despite obstacles small FIs may encounter when it comes to a digital transformation, there are many advantages and strategies they can utilize to reach success and remain competitive in the space.

How can smaller FIs use digital to their advantage?

While smaller and midsize FIs may lack the financial resources as their larger counterparts, they tend to have higher consumer trust than some of the largest US banks. This trust could offset some of their delayed innovations. Additionally, their deeper customer relationships can enable them to roll out more granularly personalized products.

Smaller FIs can also offer more competitive rates on financial products than large and giant banks, which they can combine with convenient application processes to deepen customer loyalty.

Innovation strategies for small and midsize FIs

Despite the financial and digital obstacles smaller and midsize FIs face, there are key strategies they can harness. Below are some of the strategies Insider Intelligence outlines in the Strategies for Small and Midsize FIs Report:

Partner: Teaming up with a fintech or software vendor either to leverage its existing products or shape the design of new ones is often the best option open to smaller FIs due to cost efficiency and faster time to market.

Teaming up with a fintech or software vendor either to leverage its existing products or shape the design of new ones is often the best option open to smaller FIs due to cost efficiency and faster time to market. Build: Building digital products and services in-house from scratch with no or minimal input from vendors is typically cost prohibitive for smaller FIs, but some are customizing this approach by heavily adapting off-the-shelf products.

The Canadian banks that offer the most desirable mobile banking app features in 2021 are RBC, TD Canada, and BMO, according to the inaugural Insider Intelligence Canada Mobile Banking Emerging Features Benchmark.

Smartphone banking adoption will slow. Insider Intelligence

After an uptick in 2020, growth in Canadian consumers smartphone banking adoption will slow to a trickle, according to an Insider Intelligence forecast. Financial institutions (FIs) can no longer rely on new smartphone owners to grow their ranks of mobile users, and they need to distinguish their mobile offerings to gain the upper hand when they compete for new customers.

The Insider Intelligence 2021 Canada Mobile Banking Emerging Features Benchmark examines the offerings of the seven largest Canadian FIs by assets to determine which banks best meet customer demand for advanced mobile banking features.

Heads of product and channels use this report to gauge mobile performance and plan their product road maps. It highlights which of 42 advanced mobile banking features the top seven Canadian FIs by assets deploy, and uses a dedicated survey of 1,187 Canadian consumers fielded in November and December 2020 to determine which of those features they most demand.

RBC offered the most in-demand mobile app feature set. Insider Intelligence

More than 40% of members in Congress, or more than 220 representatives and senators, own individual stocks, collectively holding at least $225 million in stock assets, Insider has found.

Those in Congress are prohibited from using insider information to profit from the stock market. But it is legal for them to buy and sell individual stocks — a policy that can result in potential conflicts of interest in legislators financial dealings.

Tech stocks were the most popular

Those in Congress favor tech stocks, Insiders analysis showed. Apple, the top stock and one of the hottest investments in recent years, was held by 72 members, or more than 13% of Congress.

Microsoft, the second-most-popular stock, was held by 64 members, followed by Disney and Alphabet, tied with 45 owners. Close behind was Amazon, owned by 44 members.

Together, the five companies spent $48 million on lobbying in 2020, according to OpenSecrets. PACs linked to the five companies along with the companies employees made an estimated $89.9 million in federal political contributions during the 2020 election cycle, which includes the calendar year 2019.

Leading investments include big lobbying forces, from pharma to oil to defense

Pharmaceutical and biotechnology giants are also popular investments for elected officials.

Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer, the makers of COVID-19 vaccines, were the most-held pharmaceutical stocks in Congress in 2020, owned by 44 and 37 members, respectively.

Congress stock trades in particular are worthy of scrutiny. Despite a law requiring members to quickly and publicly disclose when they buy and sell stocks and corporate bonds, Insider found that many have failed to comply, often disclosing trades late, if at all.

Lawmakers personal financial interests sometimes intersect with their public duties.

Reps. Robert Wittman, a Republican from Virginia, and Steve Cohen, a Democrat from Tennessee, owned Exxon Mobil stock. Both lawmakers sit on the House Committee on Natural Resources, which is responsible for overseeing various elements of the fossil-fuels industry. Overall, 36 members of Congress owned Exxon Mobil stock in 2020, making it the 12th-most-owned stock in Congress.

Insider also discovered that some members of Congress held stocks that their committees have direct influence over, such as 15 members sitting on the House and Senate Armed Services committees who are simultaneously invested in defense contractors.

Shares of Alibaba, a multinational Chinese tech firm with ties to the countrys ruling Communist Party, were owned by 20 members of Congress, including Republican Sens. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama and Roger Marshall of Kansas, two outspoken critics of Chinas government. Both senators this year violated the federal Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012 by not properly disclosing some of their stock trades.

How we analyzed Congress financial disclosures

Insider this autumn collected and analyzed financial disclosures filed by each member of Congress, making them searchable and sortable whereas they previously were not. Covering 2020 — a year in which the worlds richest people witnessed their fortunes grow substantially — the reports provide the most recent comprehensive overview of each members financial assets.

They revealed at least $2.6 billion in wealth held by federal legislators.

Senate and House members file their disclosures in different formats. Insider used natural-language-processing software — including an algorithm that analyzes text — to help determine the most commonly traded stocks in the House.

Insiders analysis did not include four members of Congress whose disclosures were uniquely complicated, incomplete, illegible, or long, comprising hundreds of pages of handwritten or scanned documents. Those members are Democratic Reps. Ro Khanna of California, Vicente Gonzalez of Texas, and Kurt Schrader of Oregon, and Republican Rep. Harold Rogers of Kentucky. A cursory review of their filings showed that Khanna, Schrader, and Rogers held extensive stock portfolios, and that they or immediate family members frequently traded individual stocks in 2020.');

Lawmakers are torn about how to regulate cryptocurrency. But that hasnt stopped some members of Congress and their senior staffers from investing in it.

At least one senator and four US House representatives have bought stock in cryptocurrency-related companies or invested with brokerage firms that work with this emerging market, according to an Insider analysis of federal records detailing the lawmakers personal finances for 2020.

Meanwhile, Congress has been introducing legislative proposals aimed at better regulating crypto.

Sen. Cynthia Lummis, a Republican of Wyoming who sits on the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, is an outlier among her colleagues. In her January 2021 report, she reported owning between $50,001 and $100,000 in Bitcoin. Shes among a handful of members of Congress who accept cryptocurrency campaign contributions.

But Lummis was several days late reporting a purchase in August of up to $100,000 in Bitcoin. Lummiss spokeswoman Abegail Cave told Insider that the Wyoming senator has gone above and beyond to comply with federal law and Senate Ethics requirements regarding financial disclosures.

Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a Republican of New Jersey, reported up to $250,000 in an investment trust operated by Grayscale, the worlds largest digital-currency asset-management firm. The office of Van Dew did not respond to Insiders comment on what kind of investment trust he has with the firm.

Democratic Rep. Jake Auchincloss, a 33-year-old freshman of Massachusetts, reported up to $15,000 in Flipside Crypto Investor Holdings.

Rep. Barry Moore, a Republican of Alabama, reported investing up to $15,000 with a brokerage firm in Coffee, Alabama. The description of the firm on his financial disclosure said crypto currency. His office did not respond to Insiders request for comment on which brokerage firm he was using. His disclosure said the firm paid $2,501 to $5,000 in dividends in 2020.

Jim Newman, the husband of Rep. Marie Newman, a Democrat of Illinois, has traded stock in the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase at least 16 times. The most recent trade, a sale valued at $50,001 to $100,000, occurred in November.

Also in November, Newmans husband purchased up to $50,000 worth of stock in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.

Congressional ethics officials say that the most comprehensive approach for lawmakers to eliminate conflicts of interests and the appearance of them is to form whats known as a qualified blind trust, a financial vehicle the House or Senate ethics committee approves that a trustee manages independently.

Most members of Congress have not established qualified blind trusts, which are often expensive and time-consuming to establish.

Staffers charge into crypto

Lawmakers are not the only ones getting in on the cryptocurrency action.

Insider identified 21 high-ranking congressional staffers or their spouses who in 2020 and 2021 bought or sold cryptocurrencies, including ethereum and dogecoin, a cryptocurrency originally created as a joke among crypto enthusiasts thats grown in value over the past year.

The tally is part of the exhaustive Conflicted Congress project, in which Insider reviewed nearly 9,000 financial-disclosure reports for every sitting lawmaker and their top-ranking staffers.

Senior staffers and some other aides on Capitol Hill are bound by federal law to file timely reports about all their stock transactions and other outside earnings if they make more than $132,552 annually. Thats generally the salary minimum for chiefs of staff; the staffers and aides also include chief counsels, legislative directors, and staff members who work on committees and advise lawmakers on policy.

The extent to which other Capitol Hill office employees with lower salaries hold cryptocurrency and crypto-related stocks is unknown because they are not required to disclose it.

Kristin Walker, Lummis chief of staff, told Insider that she started investing in bitcoin in the summer of 2020, before Lummis was elected and before she came to work on the Hill.

Wyoming has been at the forefront of digital assets for the past few years, and I learned about it through Wyomings efforts, Walker said.

Another crypto investor was Scott Sloofman, the staff director for the Senate Republican Communications Center under Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. He purchased between $1,001 to $15,000-worth of Coinbase shares in April. He did not respond to Insiders inquiry about his investments.

More senior staffers than lawmakers have invested in cryptocurrency does not come as a surprise to Ron Hammond, the director of government affairs for the Blockchain Association.

There has been a massive uptick in staffers who either have crypto or are really interested in the issue, and I think its more of a generational thing, Hammond, who worked on Capitol Hill as a former congressional staffer for many years.

The average age of members of the House at the beginning of the current 117th Congress was 58.4 years, according to the Library of Congress. The average age for senators was 64.3 years.

The idea of lawmakers and congressional staffers investing in cryptocurrency is exciting, Hammond said.

For those who want to get involved in crypto legislation, its important to maybe have some foot in it, he said. It does help increase your knowledge about how everything is supposed to work or you know what some flaws may be.

Congress tries to get a grip on digital assets

Crypto chatter has ratcheted up on Capitol Hill in recent months as supporters and opponents of digital assets sketch out their respective visions about what the future might hold.

In early June, Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia and Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri proposed tightening cryptocurrency rules to better trace electronic payments to ransomware attackers.

A few weeks later, Rep. Maxine Waters, a Democrat of California who also chairs the House Committee on Financial Services, told attendees at a subcommittee hearing that she and her colleagues are committed to providing not only more transparency in this minimally-regulated industry, but to ensuring that appropriate safeguards are in place.

So we have begun a thorough examination of this marketplace, the 16-term lawmaker announced during a two-hour discussion weighing whether cryptocurrencies would lead to financial independence or fiscal ruin.

Along the way, House lawmakers quietly passed a bipartisan bill instructing the Federal Trade Commission to provide Congress with recommendations to further protect consumers from unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the digital token marketplace.

Come late July, Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat of Michigan who also chairs the House Homeland Security subcommittee on intelligence and counterterrorism, urged administration officials to lay out their wish list now for stronger cryptocurrency curbs. If you need changes to legislation, if you need resources, we want to hear more from you, not less, Slotkin said during a 90-minute discussion tagged terrorism and digital financing.

Earlier this month, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a crypto skeptic whos characterized it as unreliable tech with unpredictable fees, said the industry harmed the planet by necessitating huge, energy-sucking mines, computer facilities designed to solve complex math problems to obtain the digital coins.

Cryptomining has huge environmental costs & is raising energy prices for consumers. Bitcoin alone consumes as much energy as Washington state, the Massachusetts Democrat tweeted.

A few days later, House lawmakers quizzed the CEOs of a half-dozen crypto-focused companies about their business practices.

The six witnesses, who handle everything from the logistics of mining bitcoin to branching out into other blockchain-based investments, spent four hours answering questions about the pros and cons of cryptocurrencies and their place in the modern economy.

Daniel Gallagher, the chief legal officer for the financial-services company Robinhood, tried to manage expectations ahead of the hearing, telling CNBC that its a stretch to believe that there will be legislation coming out on crypto anytime soon.

Crypto associations bulk up lobbying efforts

The flurry of talks surrounding regulation has prompted more cryptocurrency associations to strengthen their lobbying efforts on Capitol Hill.

By August, cryptocurrency interests had collectively spent $2.4 million lobbying the federal government, including Congress, according to OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan research organization that tracks money in politics.

The interests lobbied against portions of the bipartisan infrastructure bill that would impose new tax-reporting requirements on crypto brokers that could pave the way for stronger regulations.

The lobbying efforts were unsuccessful. President Joe Biden signed the infrastructure bill into law in November. The crypto-broker policy is expected to raise $28 billion over 10 years to help fund infrastructure projects, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.

Five years ago, the House created the bipartisan Congressional Blockchain Caucus to consider policymaking. One of the leaders of the group was Mick Mulvaney, a Republican congressman from South Carolina who later became President Donald Trumps chief of staff.

The current chairmen of the caucus are GOP Reps. Tom Emmer of Minnesota and David Schweikert of Arizona and Democratic Reps. Bill Foster of Illinois and Darren Soto of Florida. None reported holding any cryptocurrencies in their 2020 financial disclosures.

Emmer told MinnPost in October that he started reading about crypto after one of his staffers left the book The Age of Cryptocurrency on his desk back in 2015 or 2016. He has introduced several crypto-related bills, including the Securities Clarity Act, which would allow regulators to categorize cryptocurrencies as either a commodity, a security, or a currency.

But overall, lawmakers have been slow to embrace cryptocurrency because it hasnt been around for a long time, Najah Roberts, the founder of Crypto Blockchain Plug, a brick-and-mortar cryptocurrency exchange and education center, told Insider.

They are afraid of that technology, she said.

Roberts said she hoped more lawmakers would invest in the market.

It will be great if they do because then that will give them a better understanding on how to acquire the asset, how they feel about securing the asset, she said.');

New York reported a record-breaking 21,027 positive COVID-19 cases on Thursday, according to state data.

Its the highest recorded number of daily new cases, breaking the record set on January 14, 2021, when 19,942 people tested positive for COVID-19.

There were 263,536 tests conducted across New York on Thursday, and the state said its averaging a 5.73% positivity rate over the last seven days.

The winter surge in COVID-19 cases is a reminder that the pandemic is not over yet and we must take extra care to keep ourselves and each other safe, Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a statement on Friday.

The vaccine is still our best weapon to defeat the virus and ensure we are safe from serious illness, she added. Get the shot if you havent yet and the booster if you have, mask up, and wash your hands.

As cases spike across the state, testing sites around New York City have been plagued by long lines and wait times, CBS New York reported on Friday. Photos shared on social media show lines stretching around city blocks as people try to get tested.

A middle school teacher from Brooklyn told news outlet The City that she had to take the entire day off work and waited for three hours to get tested.

AMSTERDAM, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Dutch urban centres were largely deserted on Sunday as the country began a snap lockdown that, aimed at stemming an expected COVID-19 surge caused by the fast-spreading Omicron variant, left peoples Christmas plans in disarray.

Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced the shutdown on Saturday evening, ordering the closure of all but essential stores, as well as restaurants, hairdressers, gyms, museums and other public places from Sunday until at least Jan. 14.

In Rotterdam, police used a water cannon to disperse a group of around 1,000 people who had gathered outside the citys main soccer stadium, ahead of a clash between local team Feyenoord and bitter rivals Ajax Amsterdam.

Several people were held as fireworks and bottles were thrown at police and at the Ajax team bus, news agency ANP said.

Spectators have been barred from Dutch sporting events since the end of November.

The new curbs, which also include a ban on gatherings outside of more than two people, were unexpected, and many people rushed out on Saturday to stock up on presents or get a last-minute festive haircut. read more

Hospitality workers demanded compensation for lost income over the holiday season.

Closing all bars and restaurants in such an important month is incredibly painful and dramatic. We need compensation and an exit strategy, the Dutch association for hospitality services said.

Dutch coronavirus infections have dropped from record levels after a night-time lockdown came into force last month. But Omicron cases are increasing rapidly and the variant is expected to become dominant before the end of the year.

Hospitals have already been cancelling regular operations for weeks as they try to avoid running out of beds due to high numbers of COVID-19 patients.

The government also said on Saturday that it would accelerate its booster vaccine programme. More than 85% of Dutch adultsare double-vaccinated, fewer than 9% have had a booster shot, one of the lowest rates in western Europe.

After this weekends games, we have agreed to put into place a new set of protocols, which will include a more targeted testing plan, more flexibility for players to attend meetings virtually and also a high-risk player opt-out for the remainder of the season, the league said.

The NFL did not give details of the new testing system, but Pro Football Talk reported that the league would eliminate the regular testing of vaccinated, asymptomatic players.

The report said the current system, in which vaccinated players with no symptoms are tested once a week, would be replaced with a random process that would test a handful of asymptomatic vaccinated players.

It added that mandatory weekly testing of all vaccinated players would also end.

The NFL said on Wednesday that its COVID-19 vaccination rate stood at 94.6% among players and nearly 100% among personnel, while 30 of the leagues 32 clubs have an overall vaccination rate of 95% or higher.

MOSCOW, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Russian natural gas deliveries to Germany through the Yamal-Europe pipeline have fell again on Sunday after rising briefly from Saturday levels, data from German network operator Gascade showed.

By midday, flows at the Mallnow metering point on the German-Polish border were down to an hourly volume of around 370,000 kilowatt hours (kWh/h), falling from the levels of just over 4,000,000 kWh/h briefly seen during the day.

The flows, a major route for Russian gas to Europe which bypasses Belarus, continued to fall from Saturday levels when they fell sharply to around 1,200,000 kWh/h from an average of between 9,000,000 to 12,000,000 kWh/h seen in December. read more

It was not immediately clear why the flows were down. Russian gas exporter Gazprom did not reply to a request for comment.

Russian gas supplies to Europe are closely tied with levels of gas in Gazproms storage at home. The company this week started to lift gas from its underground facilities in central Russia, with peak consumption expected in a month.

Gazprom sends gas to Europe via a number of routes and is booking extra capacity - or volumes which come on top of firm contracts - at auctions for delivery via Ukraine and to Germany via the Yamal route.

Gazprom booked no extra supplies via the Yamal pipeline at a monthly auction for December delivery and is taking small export capacity at daily auctions from time to time when it sees requests from customers.

Summary Frost resignation a surprise to Brussels

UK refusal to compromise untenable -Mairead McGuinness

Says new COVID-19 variant might add pressure for deal

DUBLIN, Dec 19 (Reuters) - A European Commissioner said on Sunday that British Prime Minister Boris Johnsons refusal to compromise on Brexit was untenable and called on him not to let Conservative Party machinations determine his replacement for Brexit minister David Frost.

EU Financial Services Commissioner Mairead McGuinness, Irelands appointment to the European Commission, said she hoped that the Omicron variant of COVID-19 and other big issues would help nudge Britain to reciprocate on concessions made by Brussels.

The resignation on Saturday of Frost, a core architect of Johnsons tumultuous Brexit strategy, raised questions about the future tone of the EU divorce and the immediate course of talks on Northern Ireland. It also added to a sense of turmoil in Johnsons Conservative government. read more

McGuinness, who said the Commission was not given any advance warning of Frosts resignation, speculated that Frosts move could have been linked to an easing of British opposition to the role of the European Court of Justice.

I would hope that the mood will be towards compromise and problem solving, not Conservative Party politics, which Im afraid takes the eye off the real ... issues, and will drag out this into next year, which is not good for Northern Ireland, McGuinness told Irish state radio RTE.

If people [in London] are of the view that there will be no compromise, then there will be no progress and thats untenable, she said.

McGuinness called on Johnson to resist pressure to choose a hardliner as Frosts replacement.

If the priority is simply to appease hardliners in the Conservative Party, I think we are in a very bad place, she said.

She said the focus had to be on the issues and that it would be alarming if progress is dependent on the personality of the negotiator. Frosts replacement should be fully briefed and begin by acknowledging the concessions made by Brussels.

Were entering 2022. A referendum happened in 2016. ... We must focus on Northern Ireland, not the internal machinations of the Tory Party, she said.

LONDON/WASHINGTON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - The Netherlands went into lockdown on Sunday and the possibility of more COVID-19 restrictions being imposed ahead of the Christmas and New Year holidays loomed over several European countries as the Omicron variant spreads rapidly.

In the United States, White House medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci urged people travelling to visit loves ones to get booster shots and always wear masks in crowded public spaces.

He said Omicron was raging through the world and that travelling will increase the risk of infection even among vaccinated people. Since the start of the month, U.S. COVID cases have risen 50%, according to a Reuters tally.

Dutch urban centres were largely deserted as the country began a snap lockdown that threw peoples Christmas plans into disarray.

Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced the shutdown on Saturday evening, ordering the closure of all but essential stores, as well as restaurants, hairdressers, gyms, museums and other public places from Sunday until at least Jan. 14.

Omicron, a very contagious variant first detected last month in southern Africa and Hong Kong, has raced around the globe and been reported in 89 countries, the World Health Organization said on Saturday. It said the number of Omicron cases is doubling in 1.5 to 3 days in areas with community transmission, but noted that much remains unknown about the variant, including the severity of the illness it causes.

While the Netherlands took the plunge and shut down much of public life to prevent its healthcare system from being overwhelmed, several other European governments are considering additional curbs - at a time when businesses count on people spending more heavily than usual on shopping, entertainment and travel.

Overall COVID infections are rising in 64 out of 240 countries and territories tracked by Reuters, with 12 countries recording more cases than at any point during the pandemic, including the United Kingdom.

Sajid Javid, the health minister, declined on Sunday to rule out the chance that Prime Minister Boris Johnsons government will impose further restrictions before Christmas.

He said the government was taking the sobering advice of its scientists seriously, was watching the data closely, and would balance both against the broader impact of restrictions on areas such as businesses and education.

Johnson is reeling after a series of scandals and missteps, and more than 100 of his own Conservative lawmakers this week voted against the governments latest measures to tackle what he had warned was going to be a tidal wave of Omicron cases.

Javid said Johnson was not too politically weak to bring in further curbs if necessary.

In Italy, the government is considering new measures to avoid a surge in infections during the holiday period, local newspapers reported on Sunday.

After meeting with ministers on Dec. 23, Prime Minister Mario Draghi could mandate that people who have been vaccinated also show a negative test to access crowded places, including nightclubs and stadiums, daily Corriere della Sera reported.

Germanys health minister Karl Lauterbach ruled out a Christmas lockdown on Sunday but warned a fifth COVID-19 wave could no longer be stopped, adding that he viewed mandatory vaccination as the only way to end the pandemic. read more

The government is gearing up for the next phase of battle in a two-year fight against a virus that has killed 800,000 people in the United States and disrupted every aspect of daily life.

Two U.S. senators, Democrats Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker, said on Sunday they tested positive for COVID-19 but were experiencing only mild symptoms. read more

Warren, 72, said on Twitter she was grateful for the protection provided against serious illness that comes from being vaccinated and boosted, and urged other Americans to do the same.

Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, told CBS Face the Nation that the number of Omicron cases will rise steeply in the next two weeks.

A big message for today is if youve had vaccines and a booster, youre very well protected against Omicron causing you severe disease. So, anybody listening to this whos in that 60% of Americans who are eligible for a booster but havent yet gotten one: This is the week to do it. Do not wait, he said.

Omicron is multiplying rapidly, making COVID-19 vaccinations and booster shots more crucial than ever, chief White House medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci said on Sunday. Currently, 27% of U.S. residents have not gotten even a single dose of vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

It is just, you know, raging through the world, Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on NBCs Meet the Press.

Omicron has been found in 43 out of 50 U.S. states and around 90 countries so far.

WAR FOOTING

New York state recorded 22,478 positive COVID-19 cases on Saturday, Governor Kathy Hochul tweeted on Sunday, marking the states third daily record in new positive cases in three days.

More than half of the states new cases recorded on Saturday were in New York City, where Mayor Bill de Blasio called for the country to go on a war footing to fight the Omicron variant with more vaccinations. He said the city would spend $10 million on an advertising campaign to promote booster shots.

The number of cases is doubling in 1.5 to three days in areas with community transmission, the World Health Organization said on Saturday.

In certain regions of the United States, 50% of the COVID-19 tests genetically sequenced detected the Omicron variant, Fauci told CNN, which means its going to take over.

The virus is forcing sports teams to reschedule games and entertainment venues to cancel shows. The National Basketball Association postponed five additional games on Sunday.

The National Hockey League said it agreed with its players association to continue its 2021-22 regular-season schedule, as nearly all players and staff are vaccinated, but would temporarily shut down individual teams on a case-by-case basis. It also postponed cross-border games involving Canadian and U.S.-based teams through Dec. 23.

Colorado Governor Jared Polis told NBC he was considering changing the definition of fully vaccinated in his state to threeshots from two. I wish theyd stop talking about it as a booster. It really is a three-dose vaccine, he said.

BOOSTERS, TESTING, SURGE TEAMS

President Joe Biden plans to give a speech on Tuesday about the rising COVID-19 cases, hammering home his message to unvaccinated Americans to get a shot and for those who are vaccinated to get a booster.

Part of Bidens strategy is to focus on increased testing, Fauci told CNNs State of the Union.

We really need to flood the system with testing. We need to have tests available for anyone who wants them, he said.

Hospitals in some parts of the country are already becoming strained by COVID-19 patients and things are likely to get worse, the health officials said.

The government is prepared now to start sending out surge teams as needed to places that are really hit hard and the presidents going to have more to say about that in a speech on Tuesday, Collins said.

Neither Fauci nor Collins urged vaccinated Americans to cancel travel plans - just to wear a mask at all times in airports, on planes, trains and buses.

Im not going to say you shouldnt travel, but you should do so very carefully, Collins said.

LONDON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Britains health minister on Sunday declined to rule out the chance of further COVID-19 restrictions before Christmas, saying the spread of the Omicron variant was a very fast moving situation.

Asked whether he could rule out new restrictions before Christmas, health minister Sajid Javid told BBC Television: We are assessing the situation, it is very fast moving.

There are no guarantees in this pandemic I dont think. At this point, we just have to keep everything under review.

Javid said the government was watching the data on an almost hourly basis and listening to its scientific advisers and would balance that against the broader impact of restrictions on things such as businesses and education.

He said there was a still a lot that is not known about Omicron but waiting until data is clearer may leave it too late to react to it.

Cabinet Office minister Steve Barclay held a meeting of the governments emergency committee on Sunday to discuss the situation with the UKs devolved administrations and agreed to increase their funding to tackle the spread of Omicron.

They agreed to continue to monitor the emerging data over the coming days, working closely with businesses and public agencies across the UK to understand the impact on industry and services, a Cabinet Office spokesperson said.

More than 100 of Prime Minister Boris Johnsons own Conservative lawmakers voted against the governments latest measures to tackle the spread of COVID-19 earlier this week and Johnson is facing the biggest crisis of his premiership after a litany of scandals and missteps.

Asked if Johnson was too weak to bring in further curbs, Javid said: No ... if the government felt that further action had to be taken of course we would present that to parliament and it would be for parliament to decide.

The number of confirmed Omicron cases recorded across the country was 37,101 as of 1800 GMT on Dec. 18, the UK Health Security Agency said on Sunday, up by more than 12,000 cases from 24 hours earlier. Twelve people believed to have had the Omicron variant had died as of Friday.

Javid said the actual number of Omicron infections was likely to be a lot higher.

The number of all new COVID-19 cases reported in official data on Sunday was 82,886, up 51.9% over the seven days to Dec. 19 compared with the previous week.

Javid said the government believed about 60% of new COVID-19 cases in England were now Omicron.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he thought new restrictions were inevitable otherwise the health service would be on the verge of collapse under the joint pressures of staff shortages and increased hospitalisations.

MADRID, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Thousands of people dressed as Santa Claus took part in a charity run through Madrid on Sunday to raise money for people affected by a three-month volcanic eruption on the Spanish island of La Palma.

Decked out in classic red and white outfits, the runners set off in a flurry of fake snow along the Paseo de la Castellana, a major boulevard through the city centre.

Some runners swapped Santas traditional red trousers for more sporty shorts, while many wore face masks as a coronavirus precaution.

You have to try to be careful, especially close to Christmas, said Teresa, taking part with her colleagues, who were all wearing face masks.

Thousands of people have been evacuated, at least 2,910 buildings have been destroyed and banana plantations have been devastated on La Palma, an island in the Canaries. The Cumbre Vieja volcano began spewing streams of molten lava in September, but scientists said last week the eruption could be coming to an end.

Summary Erdogan repeats opposition to high interest rates

Is under fire over currency meltdown, rising costs

President says problems not due to low-rates policy

Economists predict inflation above 30% next year

ANKARA, Dec 19 (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan said he had lowered Turkeys inflation to around 4% before and that he will achieve that again, as it topped 21% following a push for aggressive cuts in interest rates that he has engineered.

Erdogan has said that policy,which has sent the countrys lira crashing, was part of a successful economic independence war.

He says it will boost exports, employment, investments and growth, but most economists call it reckless and predict inflation will soar beyond 30% next year.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

The lira hit a record low beyond 17 against the dollar on Friday. Hit by fears of an inflationary spiral, the currency has lost 55% of its value this year and 37% in the last 30 days.

In a meeting with African youth on Saturday that was broadcast on Sunday, Erdogan reiterated his unorthodox view that interest rates cause prices rises, adding that inflation would hopefully fall soon.

Sooner or later, just as we lowered inflation all the way to 4% when I came to power, we will lower it again. But, I will not let my citizens, my people, be crushed under interest rates, Erdogan said.

Annual inflation fell to around 4% in 2011, when Erdogan was prime minister. It has been edging upwards since 2017 and in November jumped 3.5% on the month and 21.3% on the year.

Many Turks have said a 50% hike in the minimum wage announced by Erdogan on Thursday - and widely expected to boost consumer price inflation by 3.5 to 10 percentage points - will be insufficient.

Speaking on Sunday, Erdogan said Turkeys problems were due to unreasonable attacks on the economy and dismissed calls for capital controls as ridiculous.

The limited rate cuts we have done cannot be the cause of this picture, he said.

Exchanges rates were the weapon of the game being played on Turkey, and once they and prices were stabilised, we will see the doors of a much bigger, modern Turkey open to us within months.

MOUNTING CRITICISM

Under pressure from Erdogan, the central bank has cut rates by 500 basis points since September. He says the model will boost exports, employment, investments and growth.

On Saturday, Turkeys largest business group TUSIAD called on the government to abandon the low rates policy and return to rules of economic science.

Opposition parties want immediate elections but Erdogan, in power for 20 years, has dismissed this call. National elections are scheduled for mid-2023. read more

On Sunday, he called TUSIADs statement an attack on the government.

Our governments economic policy is advancing exactly as we determined, apart from temporary volatility in exchange rates, he said. I call on all my citizens to stand with their state and government more strongly over the economy.

Thousands protested in Istanbul and the southeastern city of Diyarbakir at the weekend over the surging cost of living.

Some ferry lines operating from and in Istanbul were halted on Sunday over unsustainable costs stemming from the lira crash, operators said.

PARIS, Dec 18 (Reuters) - France will compensate ski resorts hit by the ban on British tourists and will try to steer more French tourists to the mountains to make up for lost earnings, the tourism minister said on Saturday.

Under new rules taking effect on Saturday, meant to protect from importing the Omicron COVID-19 variant, holiday travel from Britain is not allowed and only French nationals and their partners, as well as foreigners with a permanent residence in France, can enter the country from the UK.

Tourism minister Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne said on BFM TV that British tourists accounted for about 15% of French ski resort customers overall, but the percentage was much higher in some resorts such as Val dIsere, Courchevel and Meribel.

Last year the government has provided 7 billion euros ($7.9 billion) of support for the sector and we will continue to stand by the industry, Lemoyne said, without specifying what measures could be implemented.

He added that because of a new lockdown in the Netherlands, Dutch tourists, who account for about 5% of the customers in French ski resorts, may also be more scarce this season. read more

The ban on British tourists was announced on Thursday, just two days before the start of the holiday season. read more

Asked whether the French government had plans to ban tourists from countries other than Britain, Lemoyne said this would depend on the health situation in those countries.

Sometimes countries go to code red (in the governments alert scale), sometimes they go back to other colours. We recommend that travelers check the foreign ministry website, he said.

Lemoyne added that French citizens would always have the right to return from any country, no matter how intense the epidemic there, but would have to submit to stricter testing and quarantine rules.

The right to return is sacred, he said.

On Friday, Moscow set out a list of demands for the West that includes withdrawing NATO battalions from Poland and Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, once part of the Soviet Union.

Russia is also demanding a legally binding guarantee that NATO will give up any military activity in Eastern Europe and Ukraine and an effective Russian veto on future NATO membership for Ukraine - which the West has already ruled out.

We need to solve the current tensions on the diplomatic level but just as well by putting up a credible deterrence, Lambrecht told reporters in Rukla on her first visit to German troops abroad.

The combat units, deployed three years after Moscows annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula Crimea in 2014, are meant to stall an assault and buy time for additional NATO troops to arrive at the frontline.

We will discuss Russias proposals...But it cannot be that Russia dictates to NATO partners their posture, and that is something that we will make very clear in the talks (next week at the NATO council), she added.

The West has threatened harsh economic sanctions on Russia should Moscow escalate its military build-up on Ukraines border. Moscow says it is only responding to threats to its security from Kyivs increasingly close relations with NATO.

Speaking alongside Lambrecht on Sunday, Lithuanias Defence Minister Arvydas Anusauskas accused Russia of trying to drive a wedge into the alliance, and said NATO must not allow Moscow to divide Europe into spheres of influence.

We need to support Ukraine with all means, which includes the delivery of lethal weapons, Anusauskas added, without giving details on what kind of weapons he meant.

Lambrecht declined to comment on a report by Spiegel on Saturday that NATOs top general Tod Wolters had suggested the alliance should establish a similar military presence as in Poland and the Baltic states in Bulgaria and Romania. read more

After the close of polling, turnout was 30.2%. Turnout in the previous legislative poll five years ago was 58%. The previous record low for a legislative election held after the citys return from British to Chinese rule was 43.6% in 2000.

The election - in which only candidates screened by the government as patriots can run - has been criticised by some activists, foreign governments and rights groups while mainstream pro-democracy parties are not participating.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

Turnout is a central issue, as observers consider it a barometer of legitimacy in an election where pro-democracy candidates are largely absent, more than a third of the seats will be selected by a committee stacked with Beijing loyalists, and a crackdown under a China-imposed national security law has jailed scores of democrats. Civil society groups have disbanded.

Only 20 of the 90 seats were filled by direct elections.

Clearly, the governments objective is to secure a high turnout. Otherwise it may delegitimise this election, said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor of political science at Hong Kongs Baptist University.

The government on Saturday sent blanket text messages to Hong Kong residents urging people to vote, and some critics called on people to stay away as a protest. It is a crime in Hong Kong to incite someone not to vote or to cast an invalid vote.

Hong Kong leaders say the poll is representative. They insist the overhaul, like the security law imposed last year, was needed to ensure stability after protracted protests that rocked the Asian financial hub in 2019.

Security was tight around the city, with 10,000 police and some 40,000 government election workers deployed.

SITUATION CRITICAL

Shortly before casting her ballot, university language teacher Tam Po-chu, 79, said the vote would promote stability and she hoped the new council would be responsive to the public. Theres no use if they do not think of the Hong Kong people, she said.

Chief Secretary John Lee, a former security chief, urged people to turn out, saying those excluded were traitors who wanted the vote to fail.

By mid-afternoon volunteers were still pressing flyers on passersby near quiet polling booths, lampposts festooned with flags.

The situation is critical, Starry Lee, the head of the largest pro-Beijing party DAB, said in a recorded loop played on a loudspeaker in the working class Wong Tai Sin district. I urge everyone to vote.

Lees appeal did not convince local fruit seller Jack Ng, who said he would not take part in an election that was neither fair nor democratic. I dont understand why she is campaigning. She will win for sure, it is absurd, said Ng, who is in his 20s.

Others who said they would not vote expressed anger at the changes that some said had turned the poll into a selection and the legislature into a puppet.

After the election system was radically changed by the government, we can no longer elect our representatives and our candidates have been locked up by the regime, said Peter, a 21-year-old student.

Under this serious suppression, refusing to vote is apparently the only way for us to express our grievances.

With transport operators offering free train, bus and tram rides, many stations were significantly busier than the polling booths.

Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam had told reporters at the start of voting that she was responsible for the election being conducted in a fair and open manner, but not on the voter turnout rate.

After polling closed she said in a statement that the 1.3 million or so ballots cast were a show of support for the improved electoral system.

Beijings Liaison Office in the city did not respond to Reuters requests for comment on voter turnout.

Before Lam spoke, several protesters from the League of Social Democrats opposition group chanted demands nearby for full universal suffrage and waved a banner reading forced to be silent ... spirit of freedom, vote with your conscience.

In the run-up to the election, 10 people were arrested for allegedly inciting people to cast blank ballots, including people who had reposted social media posts from others, according to government statements.

Since Chinas parliament in March announced the sweeping changes to Hong Kongs electoral system, including reducing the number of directly elected seats, many opposition figures have declined to run, left the city or been jailed.

Of the 153 candidates contesting the 90 seats, around a dozen say they are not aligned with the pro-Beijing or pro-establishment camp.

SANTIAGO, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Chilean leftist Gabriel Boric has widened his lead in the final polls ahead of the Andean countrys presidential election on Sunday, though the polarized race remains tight against ultra-conservative rival Jose Antonio Kast.

Ahead of the run-off ballot, two private polls seen by Reuters showed 35-year-old former student protest leader Boric edging ahead of Kast, 55, a far-right lawyer who has defended the legacy of military dictator Augusto Pinochet.

Chile, the worlds top copper producer and long a role model of market-oriented economic policy in Latin America, is set for its most divisive presidential ballot in decades, with both candidates from outside the centrist mainstream parties.

A private poll from Cadem, which surveyed 1,007 people with a margin of error of 3.1%, showed Boric taking 55% of the vote versus 45% for Kast, widening his lead over the last week when a similar poll showed him with 52% versus 48% for Kast.

A second poll by consulting firm Atlas Intel, which had shown a draw earlier in the week, now put Boric ahead with 51% voting preferences versus 49% for Kast. The survey included 4,062 people with a margin of error of 1%.

The country is in a two-week blackout period where pollsters cannot openly publish surveys on the vote, but private polls are often commissioned.

The first opinion polls after the Nov. 21 first round vote had favored Boric, though that lead had appeared to be narrowing until the most recent surveys.

I do understand his reasons. He is a principled man. Principled people do resign from the government, Javid told Sky News.

The European Commission declined to comment when asked for reaction to Frosts resignation. France’s Europe minister Clement Beaune said on Sunday it was time for the British government to rebuild a climate of trust with France and the EU.

WAR-TIME LEADER NEEDED

That view was echoed by some of Johnsons own lawmakers.

The question now is Who replaces him? Is he going to be replaced by someone who is just designed to perhaps appease a wing of the (Conservative) Party or is this actually a real opportunity to press the reset button with the EU? senior Conservative lawmaker Tobias Ellwood told Times Radio.

Frosts departure comes on top of warnings from some of Johnsons lawmakers that he must improve his leadership or face a challenge after a litany of controversies and missteps including reports of parties at his office during lockdown.

Javid said Johnson was the best person for Britains challenges but Ellwood said decision-making in the prime ministers 10 Downing Street office needed to be improved.

If you don’t have that collective direction of travel, particularly when dealing with an enduring emergency such as Covid, then people will question as to where is all this is heading, he said. This is not fair weather conditions, we need almost like a war-time leader, we need a strong No. 10.

Johnson under pressure after scandals

Opposition says government in chaos

LONDON, Dec 18 (Reuters) - British Brexit minister David Frost resigned on Saturday over disillusionment with the direction of Boris Johnsons government, dealing a major blow to the embattled prime minister as the Omicron variant sweeps the country.

The resignation of Frost, a core architect of Johnsons tumultuous Brexit strategy, raised questions about the future tone of the EU divorce and the immediate course of talks on Northern Ireland. It also added to a sense of turmoil in Johnsons Conservative government.

Frost said he was confident that Brexit was secure, but said he had concerns about the governments direction.

You know my concerns about the current direction of travel, Frost told Johnson in a letter released by Downing Street.

I hope we will move as fast as possible to where we need to get to: a lightly regulated, low tax, entrepreneurial economy, at the cutting edge of modern science and economic change.

His resignation was first reported by The Mail on Sunday, which said it was triggered by Johnsons tougher COVID restrictions but also by a broader discontent with tax rises and the cost of environmental policies.

Frost said he had agreed with Johnson earlier this month to leave in January, but because his move had been leaked it should happen with immediate effect.

We also need to learn to live with COVID, Frost said. I hope we can get back on track soon and not be tempted by the kind of coercive measures we have seen elsewhere.

Johnson said he was sorry to receive Frosts resignation.

The departure of the British governments most senior Brexit negotiator comes on top of warnings from some of his Johnsons own Conservative Party lawmakers that he must improve his leadership or face a challenge.

Johnson, who won a landslide election victory in December 2019, is facing the biggest crisis of his premiership after a litany of scandals and missteps, which his opponents say show he is unfit to be prime minister.

He has faced a barrage of criticism since a video emerged showing his staff laughing and joking about a Downing Street party during a 2020 Christmas lockdown when such festivities were banned.

Downing Street had denied a party took place. Britains top civil servant, Simon Case, has stepped down from leading the investigation into alleged parties after it was disclosed that an event had been held in his own office. read more

BREXIT FUTURE

Frost, a former diplomat who was repeatedly hailed by Johnson as the greatest Frost since the Great Frost of 1709, was a committed Brexit supporter who negotiated Johnsons revised EU divorce deal and a trade agreement.

He cast the United Kingdoms 2016 vote to leave the EU as part of a broader rebellion against the blocs transnational collective governance that wanted to revive the nation-state.

Having such a true Brexit believer at the heart of British power gave reassurance to Brexit supporters in the Conservative Party that Johnson would remain tough on the European Union.

Frost, until his resignation, was leading an attempt by London to renegotiate parts of the divorce deal concerning Northern Ireland.

Beyond Brexit, though, the 56 year-oldFrost was unhappy.

In a speech last month, Frost expressed his clear discontent with the course of post-Brexit British policy.

We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the European Union from Britain with Brexit, only to import that European model after all this time, Frost said in a Nov. 22 speech at the Margaret Thatcher Conference on Trade.

He disagreed with those who think we can treat the private sector as just a convenient way of keeping the public sector running.

It isnt just a source of taxes, Frost said. We cant carry on as we were before, and if after Brexit all we do is import the European social model we will not succeed.

The opposition Labour Party said the government was in chaos and said Johnson should provide clarity on what would happen in talks with the EU over the Northern Irish Protocol, a part of the divorce deal.

Boris Johnson needs to get a grip, tell us his plan for the next few weeks and bring certainty for the people of Northern Ireland by unblocking the stalemate over the Protocol, said Jenny Chapman, Labours shadow minister of state at the Cabinet Office.

It is a snapshot of an ambitious new Boeing strategy to unify sprawling design, production and airline services operations under a single digital ecosystem - in as little as two years.

Critics say Boeing has repeatedly made similar bold pledges on a digital revolution, with mixed results. But insiders say the overarching goals of improving quality and safety have taken on greater urgency and significance as the company tackles multiple threats.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

The planemaker is entering 2022 fighting to reassert its engineering dominance after the 737 MAX crisis, while laying the foundation for a future aircraft program over the next decade - a $15 billion gamble. It also aims to prevent future manufacturing problems like the structural flaws that have waylaid its 787 Dreamliner over the past year. read more

Its about strengthening engineering, Boeings chief engineer, Greg Hyslop, told Reuters in his first interview in nearly two years. We are talking about changing the way we work across the entire company.

After years of wild market competition, the need to deliver on bulging order books has opened up a new front in Boeings war with Europes Airbus (AIR.PA), this time on the factory floor.

Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury, a former automobile research boss, has pledged to invent new production systems and leverage the power of data to optimize its industrial system.

Boeings approach so far has been marked by incremental advances within specific jet programs or tooling, rather than the systemic overhaul that characterizes Hyslops push today.

The simultaneous push by both plane giants is emblematic of a digital revolution happening globally, as automakers like Ford Motor Co (F.N) and social media companies like Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) shift work and play into an immersive virtual world sometimes called the metaverse.

So how does the metaverse - a shared digital space often using virtual reality or augmented reality and accessible via the internet - work in aviation?

Like Airbus, Boeings holy grail for its next new aircraft is to build and link virtual three-dimensional digital twin replicas of the jet and the production system able to run simulations.

The digital mockups are backed by a digital thread that stitches together every piece of information about the aircraft from its infancy - from airline requirements, to millions of parts, to thousands of pages of certification documents - extending deep into the supply chain.

Overhauling antiquated paper-based practices could bring powerful change.

More than 70% of quality issues at Boeing trace back to some kind of design issue, Hyslop said. Boeing believes such tools will be central to bringing a new aircraft from inception to market in as little as four or five years.

You will get speed, you will get improved quality, better communication, and better responsiveness when issues occur, Hyslop said.

When the quality from the supply base is better, when the airplane build goes together more smoothly, when you minimize re-work, the financial performance will follow from that.

ENORMOUS CHALLENGE

Yet the plan faces enormous challenges.

Skeptics point to technical problems on Boeings 777X mini-jumbo and T-7A RedHawk military training jet, which were developed using digital tools.

Boeing has also placed too great an emphasis on shareholder returns at the expense of engineering dominance, and continues to cut R&D spending, Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia said.

Is it worth pursuing? By all means, Aboulafia said. Will it solve all their problems? No.

Juggernauts like aircraft parts maker Spirit AeroSystems (SPR.N) have already invested in digital technology. Major planemakers have partnerships with French software maker Dassault Systèmes (DAST.PA). But hundreds of smaller suppliers spread globally lack the capital or human resources to make big leaps.

Many have been weakened by the MAX and coronavirus crises, which followed a decade of price pressure from Boeing or Airbus.

They not only tell us what hardware we can buy, they are now going to specify all this fancy digital junk that goes on top of it? one supply chain executive said.

A LONG GAME

Boeing itself has come to realize that digital technology alone is not a panacea. It must come with organizational and cultural changes across the company, industry sources say.

Boeing recently tapped veteran engineer Linda Hapgood to oversee the digital transformation, which one industry source said was underpinned by more than 100 engineers.

Hapgood is best known for turning black-and-white paper drawings of the 767 tankers wiring bundles into 3-D images, and then outfitting mechanics with tablets and HoloLens augmented-reality headsets. Quality improved by 90%, one insider said.

In her new role, Hapgood hired engineers who worked on a digital twin for a now-scrapped midmarket airplane known as NMA.

She is also drawing on lessons learned from the MQ-25 aerial refueling drone and the T-7A Red Hawk.

Boeing built the first T-7A jets in simulation, following a model-based design. The T-7A was brought to market in just 36 months.

Even so, the program is grappling with parts shortages, design delays and additional testing requirements.

Boeing has a running start with its 777X wing factory in Washington state, where the layout and robot optimization was first done digitally. But the broader program is years behind schedule and mired in certification challenges.

This is a long game, Hyslop said. Every one of these efforts was addressing part of the problem. But now what we want to do is do it from end to end.

SenseTime is expected to price the deal by the end of next week and list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange before Dec. 31.

Chinese buyers were likely to take nearly all of the $317 million worth of stock in the IPO not taken by cornerstone shareholders, two of the sources said.

SenseTime had not expected the U.S decision, sources told Reuters at the time. It came as the bookbuild to raise $767 million was being finalised.

The company was working to update its prospectus to include the investment ban in its risk factor sections, sources had told Reuters.

SenseTime could launch the deal on Monday to raise the same amount as the initial Hong Kong IPO, they said, pending approval from the Hong Kong exchange of the amended risk disclosures.

SenseTime had planned to sell 1.5 billion shares in a price range of HK$3.85 to HK3.99 each, according to its initial filings.

Nov 8 (Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (REGN.O) said on Monday a single dose of its antibody cocktail reduced the risk of contracting COVID-19 by 81.6% in a late-stage trial, in the two to eight months period following the drugs administration.

Shares of the company were up about 1.2% on the update as the data is expected to support the ongoing regulatory review to extend therapys use in preventing COVID-19 in people who are not exposed to the virus.

The extended authorization could help boost sales of Regenerons antibody cocktail, in the face of competition from oral COVID-19 pills such as those being developed by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Merck & Co (MRK.N).

Data showed that Regenerons drug has the potential to provide long-lasting immunity from COVID-19 infection, said Myron Cohen, who leads monoclonal antibody efforts for the U.S. National Institutes of Health-sponsored COVID Prevention Network, making it particularly helpful for immunocompromised people and those unresponsive to vaccines.

With infections still occurring despite widespread vaccination, the immunocompromised face an ongoing risk of encountering the virus during their daily lives, Regeneron Chief Scientific Officer George Yancopoulos said.

During the 8-month assessment period, there were no hospitalizations for COVID-19 in the REGEN-COV group, but in the placebo group 6 such incidents were recorded, Regeneron said.

Regeneron said researchers were able to demonstrate the impact of its drug even after the immediate risk of household infection had subsided. It intends to rapidly share the additional data with regulatory authorities.
